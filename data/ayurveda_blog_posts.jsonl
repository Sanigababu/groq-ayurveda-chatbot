Now Kerala is the top destination of authentic Ayurveda in the World.\nThe equable climate, Ideal landscape, and Adequate infrastructure facilities with veteran Physicians make Kerala a paradise of Ayurveda.\nKerala has a strong\u00a0\nAshtavaidya\n\u00a0tradition.\nKerala\u2019s deeply rooted Sanskrit heritage also enables the physicians to understand the original Ayurvedic books written in Sanskrit.\n\u00a0A medicine system founded upon the bedrock of \nPancha\n \nmahabhoothas\n (Five essential elements \u2013Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space) witnessed a massive acceptance in Kerala.\nFive Great Elements of Ayurveda\n\u00a0\nAyurvedic doctors in Kerala, the Vaidyas, contributed to developing all refreshed locally suitable traditional procedures and medicines to treat even serious diseases.\nThe regional medicinal practices were incorporated into existing courses in Ayurveda. \nThey were masters in this science which are divided mainly into eight branches called Ashtangas.\nAshtangas or branches of Ayurveda are\nKayachikitsa (General medicine)\nKoumarabhrithya(Paediatrics)\nGrahachikitsa (Psychiatry)\nSalakya Tantra (Eye, ENT)\nSalyatantra (Surgery)\nAgadatantra (Toxicology)\nRasayana (Rejuvenation therapy)\nVajeekarana tantra (Infertility and \nSexual problems treatment). Thorough knowledge of medicinal plants and their therapeutic uses was the hallmark of Kerala Vaidyas.\nAshtanga or Branches of Ayurveda\n\u00a0\n \nOrigin Of Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n \nThere is a myth that Lord Parashuram was the reason behind the origin of Ayurveda Treatment in Kerala.\nThe legend is that Lord Parashurama brought Brahmins to Kerala and assigned eight branches of Ayurveda to eight different families.\nThese families later came to be known as the ashtavaidyas, which means the Eight Physicians.\nAnother legend says that the eight prominent disciples of Vaagbhata, a Buddhist physician from Sind who followed the Ashtangahridayam methodology of treatment, later came to be known as the original Ashtavaidyas.\nIt is also believed that he wrote the entire Ashtangahridayam while sitting on a rock near Thiruvizha temple.\nAyurveda is also said to be the sub from Atharva Veda, one of the four Vedas dealing with treating diseases using natural herbs and processes.\nAyurveda is the oldest system of healing globally, with a history heading to 5000 years.\nThe Ayurvedic treatments and procedures are purely natural and do not contain any side effects.\n\u00a0\n \nBenefits of Ayurvedic Treatments in Kerala\n \nIn its modern incarnation, Ayurveda treats innumerable new ailments while retaining its ancient values. We should not be ignorant of the benefits that Ayurveda gives to our health.\n \n1.\tRelieves stress\n \nAyurveda is designed to keep your body close to nature and create spiritual awareness in you.

Organize your everyday life as prescribed by Ayurveda. It will bring joy and peace to mind.\nMeditation\n: Meditation helps to relax the mind and body. Meditation is also suitable for reducing the levels of hormones that cause stress.\n \n2.\tReduces overweight\n \nWeight loss will be followed by diet and exercise as prescribed by Ayurveda. Ayurvedic dieting is good for the body in many ways:\nThe body expels toxins\nRemoves excess fat from body cells\nCleanses the skin\nEliminates body odor\nRegulates blood circulation\n \n3.\tBalancing hormones\n \nAyurveda helps to regulate the right amount of hormones in the body.\nThis will normalize the menstrual cycle and resolve the hormonal issues that women may have during childbirth.\nAbhyangam (an oil bath) and exercise are very effective in regulating hormone levels.\n \n4.\tReduces heart burning\n \nHeartburn is a problem caused due to poor eating habits and lack of sleep.\nAyurveda prescribes very effective treatments for heartburn.\nTurmeric and ginger are the main ingredients used in Ayurveda to treat heartburn\n \n5.\tThe body expels toxins.\n \nAyurveda is a treatment that purifies the body, mind, and soul.\nAyurvedic panchakarma treatments can help expel toxins from the body and restore the function of the body organs. Massage with oil will rejuvenate the body.\n \n6.\tReduces the risk of disease\n \nAyurvedic diet, sunbathing, and pranayama will protect the body from diseases.\nAyurveda follows the approach of preventing disease rather than treating it after an illness.\n \n7.\tContributes to overall health\n \nAyurveda is a form of treatment that focuses on healing as well as personal development.\nAyurveda is a method of detecting the roots of the disease and eradicating the disease from the body completely.\nAyurvedic Treatments aim to increase immunity and prevent the recurrence of the disease.\n \n8.\tProtects the health of the skin\n \nIf you want healthy glowing skin, Ayurveda can help you achieve it.

Now Kerala is the top destination of authentic Ayurveda in the World.\nThe equable climate, Ideal landscape, and Adequate infrastructure facilities with veteran Physicians make Kerala a paradise of Ayurveda.\nKerala has a strong\u00a0\nAshtavaidya\n\u00a0tradition.\nKerala\u2019s deeply rooted Sanskrit heritage also enables the physicians to understand the original Ayurvedic books written in Sanskrit.\n\u00a0A medicine system founded upon the bedrock of \nPancha\n \nmahabhoothas\n (Five essential elements \u2013Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space) witnessed a massive acceptance in Kerala.\nFive Great Elements of Ayurveda\n\u00a0\nAyurvedic doctors in Kerala, the Vaidyas, contributed to developing all refreshed locally suitable traditional procedures and medicines to treat even serious diseases.\nThe regional medicinal practices were incorporated into existing courses in Ayurveda. \nThey were masters in this science which are divided mainly into eight branches called Ashtangas.\nAshtangas or branches of Ayurveda are\nKayachikitsa (General medicine)\nKoumarabhrithya(Paediatrics)\nGrahachikitsa (Psychiatry)\nSalakya Tantra (Eye, ENT)\nSalyatantra (Surgery)\nAgadatantra (Toxicology)\nRasayana (Rejuvenation therapy)\nVajeekarana tantra (Infertility and \nSexual problems treatment). Thorough knowledge of medicinal plants and their therapeutic uses was the hallmark of Kerala Vaidyas.\nAshtanga or Branches of Ayurveda\n\u00a0\n \nOrigin Of Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n \nThere is a myth that Lord Parashuram was the reason behind the origin of Ayurveda Treatment in Kerala.\nThe legend is that Lord Parashurama brought Brahmins to Kerala and assigned eight branches of Ayurveda to eight different families.\nThese families later came to be known as the ashtavaidyas, which means the Eight Physicians.\nAnother legend says that the eight prominent disciples of Vaagbhata, a Buddhist physician from Sind who followed the Ashtangahridayam methodology of treatment, later came to be known as the original Ashtavaidyas.\nIt is also believed that he wrote the entire Ashtangahridayam while sitting on a rock near Thiruvizha temple.\nAyurveda is also said to be the sub from Atharva Veda, one of the four Vedas dealing with treating diseases using natural herbs and processes.\nAyurveda is the oldest system of healing globally, with a history heading to 5000 years.\nThe Ayurvedic treatments and procedures are purely natural and do not contain any side effects.\n\u00a0\n \nBenefits of Ayurvedic Treatments in Kerala\n \nIn its modern incarnation, Ayurveda treats innumerable new ailments while retaining its ancient values. We should not be ignorant of the benefits that Ayurveda gives to our health.\n \n1.\tRelieves stress\n \nAyurveda is designed to keep your body close to nature and create spiritual awareness in you. Therefore, Ayurveda pays excellent attention to the health of the body and mind. Ayurveda uses various methods to relieve stress.\nRoutine\n: Get up before sunrise and start your daily routine. Organize your everyday life as prescribed by Ayurveda. It will bring joy and peace to mind.\nMeditation\n: Meditation helps to relax the mind and body. Meditation is also suitable for reducing the levels of hormones that cause stress.\n \n2.\tReduces overweight\n \nWeight loss will be followed by diet and exercise as prescribed by Ayurveda. Ayurvedic dieting is good for the body in many ways:\nThe body expels toxins\nRemoves excess fat from body cells\nCleanses the skin\nEliminates body odor\nRegulates blood circulation\n \n3.\tBalancing hormones\n \nAyurveda helps to regulate the right amount of hormones in the body.\nThis will normalize the menstrual cycle and resolve the hormonal issues that women may have during childbirth.\nAbhyangam (an oil bath) and exercise are very effective in regulating hormone levels.\n \n4.\tReduces heart burning\n \nHeartburn is a problem caused due to poor eating habits and lack of sleep.\nAyurveda prescribes very effective treatments for heartburn.\nTurmeric and ginger are the main ingredients used in Ayurveda to treat heartburn\n \n5.\tThe body expels toxins.\n \nAyurveda is a treatment that purifies the body, mind, and soul.\nAyurvedic panchakarma treatments can help expel toxins from the body and restore the function of the body organs. Massage with oil will rejuvenate the body.\n \n6.\tReduces the risk of disease\n \nAyurvedic diet, sunbathing, and pranayama will protect the body from diseases.\nAyurveda follows the approach of preventing disease rather than treating it after an illness.\n \n7.\tContributes to overall health\n \nAyurveda is a form of treatment that focuses on healing as well as personal development.\nAyurveda is a method of detecting the roots of the disease and eradicating the disease from the body completely.\nAyurvedic Treatments aim to increase immunity and prevent the recurrence of the disease.\n \n8.\tProtects the health of the skin\n \nIf you want healthy glowing skin, Ayurveda can help you achieve it.

You will be worried \nabout the unbearable \nback pain\n and stiffness. \nThe unending visits to hospitals and investigations might drain your mind and body.\n Ayurveda has the best solution to the above-described disease named Ankylosing Spondylitis.\n \nWhat is Ankylosing Spondylitis?\n \nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic and progressive inflammatory arthritis of unknown origin that primarily affects the spine (axial skeleton). Peripheral joints may also be affected by this disease. It is also known by the name Marie- Strumpell disease or Bechterew\u2019s disease and usually affects people (mainly men) in their third or fourth decade.\n\u00a0\nThis disease is a life- long condition that causes pain and stiffness in the affected region.\nAnkylosis means fused bones, and spondylitis means inflammation. In severe cases, the vertebrae or affected joints are fused, making it impossible to move.\n\u00a0\nThe disease\u2019s exact cause is unknown but can be linked to the genes. In persons with ankylosing spondylitis, it strongly relates to histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27.\n\u00a0\nIn most people, the Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C- reactive protein will be elevated.; but Rheumatoid factor and ANA will be negative. Radiographic results will be expected in the early stages. In later stages, the \u2018bamboo spine\u2019 can be visualized.\n \nSymptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis?\n \nThe clinical symptoms are first noticed in early adulthood, mostly in their third or fourth decade. The clinical manifestations include\nBack pain and stiffness:\u00a0Pain is worse in the morning, improves with activity, sudden in onset, the pain is not relieved by lying down, duration > 3 months.\nArthritis of the hip and shoulders\u00a0occurs in 25 \u2013 35 %,\u00a0other peripheral joint involvement\u00a0occurs in 30% of patients, and is usually asymmetric in origin.\nChest pain\u00a0is experienced in persons involving the thoracic skeleton and intercostal muscle insertions.\n\u00a0Bony tenderness\u00a0accompanies back pain and stiffness.\nExtra Articular pain is due to inflammation at the insertion of tendons and ligaments into the bones, which usually manifests at the heels, iliac crests, ischial tuberosities, etc.\nAcute anterior uveitis, aortic insufficiency, inflammation of the GI tract, amyloidosis\n,\n\u00a0and bilateral upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis is seen in patients.\nFever, fatigue\n,\n\u00a0and weight loss are associated with the disease.\nIn later stages, spinal fractures can occur from a minor trauma that leads to spinal cord injury.\nLimitations of movement of the spine and affected joints occur.\n \nDiagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis\n \nModified New York criteria (1984) are widely used for diagnosis. It includes:\nHistory of inflammatory back pain.\nLimitation of motion of the lumbar spine in sagittal and frontal planes\nLimited chest expansion is relative to average values for age and sex.\nDefinite radiographic sacroiliitis.\nESR and CRP will be high in blood during the inflammatory periods. Variation of HLA-B27 genes increases the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis. The majority of people diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive.\nX-ray and MRI show changes in the bone and structures related to it.\nAnkylosing Spondylitis in Ayurveda\nIn Ayurveda, Ankylosing Spondylitis can be included under the broad spectrum of the disease named Amavata. The vitiated doshas and ama (toxins formed by improper digestion in the body) get lodged in the sacroiliac and lumbosacral joints and lead to the disease. The patient\nexperiences stiffness (stabdhata) and inflammation associated with pain (saruja sopham) in Ankylosing Spondylitis which suits the symptoms of Amavata.\nThe symptoms like tiredness and fatigue (daurbalya), inflammatory issues in the GI tract (vid vibaddhatam), and cardiac problems (hridgraha) are seen in Ankylosing Spondylitis, just as in Amavata.\n\u00a0The disease Dandaka explained by Acharya Charaka, can also be correlated to Ankylosing Spondylitis. This vitiated Vata dosha causes stiffness of the joints like the head, neck, spine, and pelvis, making them immovable. This is a symptom seen in Ankylosing Spondylitis\n \nAyurvedic Treatment for Ankylosing spondylitis in Ayurveda\n \nAyurvedic Treatment for Ankylosing Spondylitis is a combination of Ayurvedic therapies, internal and external medications, diet modifications, lifestyle changes, pranayama, and meditation.\nThe treatment approach is to prevent further complications and relapses of the disease.\nThe treatment includes the removal of toxins (ama) along with the correction of the vitiated doshas.\nThe toxins interfere with the normal biological process of the body and lead to problems in the body.\nFor the removal of toxins, Panchakarma procedures must be used.\nThe standard treatment procedure for this condition:\nAbhyanga (Herbal oil massage)\nDifferent Swedana procedures like podi kizhi, ela kizhi, and manual kizhi\nDhanyamla dhara.\nLepanam and poultice or\u00a0 \nupanaham\n with rasnadi, kottamchukkadi, and grihadhoomadi choornam\nVirechana (Purgation) uses medicines like trivit lehyam, gandarvahastadi eranda tailam, nimbamritadi eranda tailam, Kalyana Gulam, etc., according to the condition of the patient.\nVasti (medicated enemas) using erandamuladi kashayam, vaitharana vasti, ksheera vasti, yapana vasti, etc., according to the patient\u2019s condition.\nAlong with the above therapeutic procedures, the intake of medicines is necessary to treat the disease. The medication commonly advised are:\nRasnapanchakam kashayam\nAmrutottaram kashayam\nGuggulutiktakam ghritam\nYogaraja Guggulu\nKaisora Guggulu\n\u00a0Rasnaerandadi kashayam.\nThese medicines and treatments must be followed after consultation with a recognized Ayurvedic physician.\n \nDietic inclusions and foods to be avoided\n \nSome specific foods and herbs must be included in the diet as well as avoided from the diet.\nThe food that must be included are:\nBarley, red rice, horse gram.\nDrum stick, bitter gourd, pointed gourd.\nGinger and garlic in buttermilk.\nWater processed with panchakola choornam.

However, back pain makes it challenging to sleep well. Despite the pain, you can do a few things to increase your odds of progressing into restorative sleep.\nPurchase a new mattress\n: \nAn old and saggy mattress, or merely too firm or soft, can aggravate back pain. It is critical to achieve quality sleep by sleeping on a mattress that provides the appropriate support and comfort. \nAdjustable beds should also be considered; many people suffering from lower back or neck pain find sleeping in a slightly reclining posture more comfortable.\nLoosen back muscles before bedtime:\n\u00a0\nStretch out painful areas before bed: Stretch out painful areas before bed may help release muscular tension. \nLocal heat treatment, such as a heating pad, aids in stretching and relieving soft tissues around the spine.\n These two easy actions alleviate enough discomfort to allow you to sleep.\nUse relaxation techniques:\n\u00a0\nMindful meditation, for example, has decreased pain perception and may provide enough relief to enable you to fall asleep. \nOther relaxing bedtime rituals, such as peaceful visualization or focused breathing, may help to divert attention away from the back discomfort and create a more comfortable atmosphere.\nTry a different sleeping position:\n\u00a0\nSleeping on one\u2019s side, curled into\n\u00a0a fetal posture, with a pillow between the legs, may aid in spinal alignment and pressure relief. \nSleeping on your back, with your knees slightly elevated by a pillow and another flat pillow tucked under your head, may encourage spinal alignment and decrease pressure on pressure points.\n As previously stated, sleeping on the back with the upper body reclined and the legs slightly bent lowers stress across the lower back.\nImportance Of Proper Rest During Back Pain Treatment\nRest may not always be beneficial for you; it depends on your condition, as bed rest is recommended only if you experience loss of bowel or bladder control, weakness, etc.\nAt any point in therapy, prolonged bed rest is not beneficial for moderate back strain. \nWhile your back may feel better soon, spending too much time in bed can lead to other issues. \nMuscles lose conditioning and tone, you may experience digestive problems such as constipation, and you are at risk of getting blood clots in your pelvic and thigh veins.\n And being confined to bed for an extended period does nothing for your mental health or well-being. \nPeople confined to bed are more likely to experience depression, as well as an increased feeling of physical weakness and malaise.\nImportance Of Exercise\nExercising and fitness activities help to keep the back healthy by enabling discs to exchange fluids, which is how the disc receives nutrition. \nA healthy disc will expand with water and squeeze it out like a sponge. \nThe sponge motion transports nutrients to the disc.\nFurthermore, fluid exchange aids in the reduction of swelling in the other soft tissues that naturally develop around injured discs. Swelling rises with a shortage of exercise, and discs become malnourished and degenerated.\nExercise you can try to strengthen your back.\nHamstring stretch\nPartial crunches\nBird dog\nKnee to chest\nBridging\nAerobic exercise\nPilates\nIt is important to note that lifestyle modifications may not eliminate back pain, especially in chronic or severe pain. \nIn these instances, medical treatment may be necessary. Overall, lifestyle modifications are a complementary approach to treating back pain, alongside any medical treatments prescribed by your doctor.\n \nFrequently Asked Questions\n \nFrequently Asked Questions about Ayurvedic Treatment for Back Pain in Kerala.

In some individuals, however, they get worse and cause life-threatening conditions known as severe dengue fever.\nThe virus is transmitted by\n Aedes\n mosquitoes, primarily the female vectors \nAedes aegypti\n and \nA albopictus\n. \nIt is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world.\nWho gets Dengue Fever?\nAnyone bitten by an infected mosquito is at risk of developing dengue fever. It is the fastest-spreading mosquito-borne disease worldwide, affecting 100 million people annually, leading to 250,000 deaths annually, and being prevalent in more than 100 countries.\nChildren and older adults are more prone to developing dengue fever. Dengue epidemics occur yearly in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific Islands, Latin America, and Africa.\nSigns and Symptoms\nThe initial symptoms of dengue fever include:\nAbrupt onset of high fever\nSevere frontal headache\nPain behind the eyes, which worsens with eye movement\nMuscle and joint pains\nLoss of sense of taste and appetite\nMeasles-like rash over chest and upper limbs\nNausea and vomiting\nMost people recover from dengue fever within a week. The symptoms can sometimes worsen, leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever. The warning symptoms of severe dengue fever include:\nFrequent vomiting with or without blood\nBleeding from nose, mouth & gums, and skin rashes.\nFatigue and restlessness\nThe patient feels thirsty, and their mouth becomes dry.\nRapid, weak pulse\nDifficulty in breathing\nClinical Presentation of dengue fever\nDengue fever begins after an incubation period of 4 to 6 days, and the course follows 3 phases.\nFebrile stage\nThe fever lasts for 2 to 7 days.\nThe affected individual may experience symptoms including severe headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, joint pain, and rashes.\u00a0\nSome may have infected oropharynx and facial erythema within 24 to 48 hours after onset.\nCritical phase\n:\u00a0\nThe second phase begins at defervescence and typically lasts 24 to 48 hours.\nMost individuals do not enter this phase, but those who do can involve complications, including shock from high fever or internal bleeding.\u00a0\nIt is the most crucial period for close monitoring.\nThe Convalescent phase\n:\u00a0\nThis is the final stage of dengue fever.\u00a0\nThe body gradually recovers, and various symptoms of dengue gradually improve.\u00a0\nThe patient\u2019s fever disappears, appetite improves, and they urinate more.\nCauses of Dengue Fever\nDengue fever is a viral infection spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes.\u00a0\nThe female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus primarily spread the dengue virus and can bite during the day and night.\nThe viruses that cause dengue fever are DENV1, DENV2, DENV4, and DENV4, which are the categories of the flavivirus genus.\nWhen an infected mosquito bites a human, the virus is transmitted into the blood and causes an infection.\nAfter recovery, an individual becomes immune to the type of virus that infected them but not to the other three types. \nAlso, there is a chance of developing severe symptoms when affected again by the dengue virus.\u00a0\nRisk Factors and Complications of Dengue Fever\nThere is a greater risk of developing dengue if:\nLiving or traveling in endemic regions such as Central and South America, Africa, and parts of Asia and Pacific islands.\nPrevious infection with dengue can increase the chance of developing severe symptoms.\nChildren below the age of 12 and older adults.\nPeople with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of developing dengue fever.\nSevere dengue can be fatal if not treated properly. The complications of dengue fever include:\u00a0\nInternal bleeding\nOrgan damage\nLiver injury\nCardiomyopathy\nPneumonia\nOrchitis\nOophoritis\u00a0\nSeizures\nEncephalopathy\nEncephalitis.\nWhen pregnant women are affected by the dengue virus, there is a chance of spreading the virus to the baby during childbirth. Pregnant women who get affected with dengue can lead to a high-risk preterm birth, low birth weight, or fetal distress in children.\nSevere Dengue Fever (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever)\nIn some individuals, the symptoms of dengue fever last more than a week and become life-threatening. This condition is known as Severe Dengue, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, or Dengue Shock Syndrome.\nThis condition develops when the virus infects the blood vessels. \nThe blood vessels become damaged and leaky, and the platelet count drops.\n It requires immediate medical attention and, if not treated, can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure, and even death.\nThe symptoms of severe dengue fever include:\u00a0\nSevere abdominal pain\nPersistent vomiting (at least 3 times in 24 hours)\nBleeding from the nose or gums\nVomiting blood or blood in the stool\nRapid breathing\nThirst and dry mouth\nDrowsiness and restlessness\nHow is dengue fever diagnosed?\nDengue fever is diagnosed through clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. \nThe healthcare provider will inquire about your medical and travel history, including any international trips, dates, and mosquito contact.\nClinical evaluation also includes physical examination and the assessment of symptoms.\n Doctors may suggest combining blood tests and imaging studies to rule out dengue, as the symptoms mimic those of Zika or Chikungunya.\nLaboratory investigation for dengue fever\nThe laboratory investigations for dengue fever include:\nNS1 Antigen Test\nThis test detects the NS1 protein of the dengue virus, which is present in the blood during the early stages of infection (usually within the first 1-5 days).\nA positive result can help confirm dengue, especially in the acute phase.\nDengue IgM and IgG Antibody Tests\nThese tests measure the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against dengue. IgM antibodies are usually detectable around 4-5 days after the onset of symptoms, peaking around 2-3 weeks and then gradually decreasing. \nIgG antibodies appear later (around the second week), remain for life, and are usually used to detect past or secondary dengue infections.\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test\nThis molecular test detects the RNA of the dengue virus in the blood. It\u2019s susceptible and specific, especially in the first week of infection, and can also help identify the particular dengue virus serotype.\nComplete Blood Count (CBC)\nA CBC is not specific for dengue but is essential for monitoring. A low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and low white blood cell (leukopenia) count occur every day in dengue. Hematocrit levels may also increase due to plasma leakage.\nLiver Function Test (LFT)\nSince dengue can affect the liver, liver function tests (such as ALT and AST) may be elevated, especially in severe cases.\nThese tests help confirm the diagnosis, determine the stage of infection, and guide clinical management.\nAyurvedic perspective of dengue fever\nIn Ayurveda, dengue fever is correlated with Dandaka Jwara, a condition described as being primarily spread by a specific type of mosquito. The signs and symptoms of Dandaka Jwara, include:\nSevere breaking pain in the bones and joints.\nSwelling and tenderness over joints.\nSymptoms of common cold(pratishaya) include cough, sore throat and throat pain.\nRise and fall of fever.\nThe complications of dengue, known as Severe Dengue, are correlated with Sannipataja jwara Lakshana with symptoms including purpura, gum bleeding, aches and pain in joints, heading, respiratory distress and cardiac involvement.\u00a0\nWhen To Seek Medical Help\nIf you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, seek medical help immediately.\nThe fever persists beyond 3 to 4 days and is unresponsive to treatment.\nSevere abdominal pain or tenderness\nPersistent vomiting\nBleeding gums, nose, and blood in the stool\nShortness of breath\nPale and cold skin.\nSevere weakness or drowsiness.\nAyurvedic treatment for Dengue Fever\nAyurvedic management of dengue fever emphasizes strengthening the immune system and controlling the temperature.\n Although modern science does not provide a particular method of managing dengue fever, Ayurvedic formulations can effectively manage the condition.\nAyurvedic formulations help treat the symptoms of Jwara using Jwarahara medicines(formulations pacifying fever), Sotha(edema) using sothahara medicines, and Vedana(pain) by providing vedana hara medicines. The therapies also boost the patient\u2019s immune system by giving rejuvenating formulations.\nAyurvedic formulations used in the management of dengue fever\nAyurvedic classics provide a wide range of potent formulations for addressing the symptoms of dengue fever. \nThese formulations are usually advised after analyzing the condition of each patient. \nThe formulations used in the management of dengue fever include:\nAmritottaram Kwath\nVettumaran Gulika\nSudarsanam tablets\nDasamoola katutrayam kwath\nDrakshadi kwath\nGodanti Bhasma\nSanshamani Vati\nFor Dehydration\u00a0\nShadanga paniya\nDhanyakadi hima\nWater or cardamom and clove\nThese liquid preparations may be given in appropriate dosage in an interval of 3 to 4 hours. \nAlways consult an Ayurvedic physician before consuming the medication, as Ayurvedic formulations are personalized for each individual\u2019s disease condition.\nHerbal remedies for the management of dengue fever\nHerbal remedies commonly recommended in Ayurveda for managing dengue fever include:\nPapaya Leaf Juice\n Papaya leaf extract is known to help increase platelet count and boost immunity, which is essential in managing dengue.\nExtract juice from fresh tender papaya leaves and take 1-2 tablespoons twice daily.\n\u00a0\nGiloy\n Giloy is a powerful immune booster, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic herb, effective in reducing fever and enhancing recovery.\nBoil a few stems of Giloy in water to make a decoction and drink it twice daily, or use Giloy tablets as per dosage instructions.\nTulsi\nTulsi leaves have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which can help fight infections and strengthen immunity.\nAdd a few fresh tulsi leaves to boiling water and drink tea 2-3 times a day.\nNeem\nNeem has antiviral and immune-boosting properties, which are beneficial in dengue management.\nBoil neem leaves in water to prepare a decoction, and drink a cup twice daily.\nAmla\n Amla is high in vitamin C and has powerful antioxidant properties that support the immune system.\nDrink fresh amla juice or take amla powder daily to aid in recovery and boost immunity.\nTurmeric\nKnown for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, turmeric can help reduce inflammation and promote faster recovery.\nAdd a pinch of turmeric powder to warm milk and drink it daily.\nFenugreek (Methi) Seeds\nFenugreek seeds can help reduce fever and alleviate pain associated with dengue.\nSoak fenugreek seeds in water overnight, strain, and drink the water.

Visit Saatwika Ayurveda Treatment Centre or book an appointment today.\n \nBook An Appointment\nAyurvedic Treatment For Disc Bulge in Kerala\n \n \nAyurvedic Treatment for disc bulge in Kerala includes a combination of herbal remedies, massages, yoga postures, and changes in lifestyle habits.\n \nWhat We Offer\nHerbal Medicine\nPanchakarma Therapies\nYoga Asana ( If necasary)\nLifestyle Modification Recommendations\nPreventive Measures\n \nMake An Enquiry\nSignificantly few people do not experience back pain and neck pain at least once in their life. It is mild for some, and it becomes a severe pain for others. And the majority of people end up continuing to take steroids for pain relief, although using them for an extended period may be quite harmful. Ayurveda can give you a safe treatment that prevents recurrence.\n\u00a0\nA disc bulge is a common orthopedic condition that usually affects the cervical and \nlumbar regions\n of the spinal cord.\u00a0\nIt is caused when the soft tissue (disc) between the vertebrae is pushed out or bulges due to wear and tear or injury.\u00a0\nDisc bulges can cause severe back pain, numbness, tingling, and limb weakness. While conventional treatment options include surgery and medication, Ayurvedic Treatment for disc bulges is an effective alternative for disc bulges. Diet and lifestyle modifications, physiotherapy, and yoga therapy will bring you out of this debilitating condition\n \nWhat is Disc Bulge?\nDisc disorders are one of the leading causes of back pain. Problems such as weak protrusion of any part of the disc and thickening due to dehydration and infection can lead to back pain and neck pain. Due to lifestyle changes, the number of people suffering from disc problems and related pains is increasing.\u00a0\nSuch issues are more common in young people. Bending, squatting, and lifting weights often put pressure on the spine.\u00a0\nThe discs are responsible for maintaining the stability and flexibility of the spine despite these stresses.\u00a0\nBut the disc begins to weaken when the stresses continue for a long time and then become unbearable.\nAlthough it is commonly said that the disc is pushed, it does not mean that the disc is completely sliding.\u00a0\nThe center of the disc contains the nucleus pulposus and is covered by annulus fibrosus.\u00a0\nIt can be described as a shell that protects the jelly-like part. Most of the stress on the disc affects the jelly-like nucleus pulposus.\u00a0\nWhen the pressure increases, this jelly will bulge out through the weak part of the outer cartilage, and this condition is referred to as a bulging disc.\n\u00a0\nDisc prolapse is a condition that is generally called a herniated disc or disc prolapse.\u00a0\nIt means that the nucleus pulposus gel part of the disc is pushed out.\u00a0\nIt also compresses the adjacent nerve rather than simply pushing it. It can also occur in the middle part of the neck.\u00a0\nWhen it occurs in the neck, it is called cervical disc prolapse; when it appears in the middle, it is called lumbar disc prolapse.\n\u00a0\nIn some, the disc prolapse stage may progress further, and the gel part may separate and move to the top or bottom of the spine.\u00a0\nThis can put too much pressure on the spinal cord. This condition is called disc prolapse and migration.\nCauses of Disc Bulge\nAging\nSmoking\nObesity\nLifting heavyweights\nDietary Causes\nIntake of too much spicy, cold, dry food, Improper eating habits, eating incompatible foods, and diet, which are irrespective of the seasonal regimen as per Ayurveda, affects the nucleus pulposus and causes disc bulge.\nLifestyle Causes\nProlonged sitting or standing can pinch the nerve roots causing pain. Excess weight gain can put pressure on the spinal disc causing disc compression. Hereditary factors can also pave the way for neurological disorders.\nSigns and Symptoms\nPain that affects the movement of the neck or lower back when walking or lifting something\u00a0\nPain spreads to the arm or leg\nPain radiating to the legs and back pain can be considered a symptom of disc prolapse.\nSymptoms of slipped discs\nPain over the affected area\nNumbness and tingling sensation\nPain gets worse at night\nWeakness in the muscles\nAching or burning sensation in the affected region\nBack pain and paralysis on one side\nLeg pain that extends all the way there\nPain gets worse when walking for brief distances\nMuscle tremor\nPain that goes all the way to the legs\nPain while walking for short distances\nHow to diagnose disc bulge?\nUnderstanding the nature of back and neck pain can help make an initial diagnosis. A physical examination can be used to understand the condition of the disease.\u00a0\nWhat matters is where the pain is, whether the pain spreads to the leg, and whether there is numbness.\u00a0\nLifestyles will also be evaluated. Tests are performed with the patient lying down and the legs raised and folded.\u00a0\nAssess how much the pain is when the leg is raised and whether the pain is relieved when lying down. A blood test can detect the presence of infection.\nX-rays can detect fractures in the vertebrae. Not only that, but it can also help identify conditions like disc degeneration and osteoporosis.\u00a0\nMRI may be used in cases where the pain is not relieved by rest.\u00a0\nThe CT scan examines how much the disc has slipped and whether it\u2019s compressing the nerve.\u00a0\nAyurvedic Treatment for disc bulge in Kerala\nThe main aim of Ayurvedic treatment is to bring the vitiated \u2018dosha\u2019 back to equilibrium and establish the state of health. \nHerbal remedies\nAyurveda utilizes various herbs that have anti-inflammatory properties to treat disc bulges. Some of the commonly used herbs include Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Guggul (Commiphora mukul), Shallaki (Boswellia serrata), and Turmeric (Curcuma longa). These herbs help reduce inflammation around the affected area and alleviate pain.\nInternal medicines are also integral to pacifying the remaining doshas, if any. These therapies are beneficial in relieving the inflammation in the nerve and other underlying causes. It also helps decrease the muscular spasm in the affected area and strengthens and nourishes the entire spine and supporting tissues.\nPanchakarma therapies\nPanchakarma therapies are an integral part of Ayurvedic treatment for disc bulges. The massage techniques in Ayurveda help relax the muscles surrounding the affected area and improve blood circulation. This helps in promoting recovery and reducing inflammation.\nAny vata-vitiated illness must be treated with snehana (oil application) and swedana. (fomentation). According to the patient\u2019s condition, treatment methods like Abhyanga, Patra Potala Swedan (Elakizhi), Choorna Swedan (Podi Kizhi), Shastika Swedan (Njavarakizhi), Dhanyamla Swedan, etc., can bring the vitiated doshas to koshta from which they can be cleared by virechana (purgation) or vast. (enema).\nAgnikarma and Sira Vyadana (Venesection), in addition to these treatments, are very successful in healing disc bulges.\nYoga and Yogasana\nYoga renders mental and physical stability. It helps in decreasing pain perception by healing the emotional aspect of pain.\nYoga postures or \u2018asanas\u2019 are an integral part of Ayurvedic treatment.\nThese postures help improve flexibility, strengthen the muscles surrounding the affected area, and alleviate pain.\nPracticing Pranayama (Anulom viloma or alternate nostril breathing) can help balance Vata.\nStart with these basic Yoga Asanas.\nPadahastasana\nPavanamukthasana\nSalabhasana\nBhujangasana\nMarjarasana\nBalasana\nVeerasana.\n\u00a0\nPrecaution:\n\u00a0To find the best poses for your situation, speak with a yoga instructor or ayurvedic doctor before attempting any of these.\nHow to prevent disc bulge\nAvoid bending while lifting\nStrengthen the paraspinal muscles\nMaintain a healthy weight\nLower your stress levels\nLifestyle modification which helps to manage disc bulge\nAyurveda emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent and treat various ailments, including disc bulges. Ayurvedic Treatment for disc bulges includes dietary changes, such as consuming foods rich in calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D to strengthen bones and reduce inflammation. Other lifestyle changes include:\nAvoiding prolonged sitting or standing.\nMaintaining proper posture while sitting and standing.\nRegular exercise.\n\u00a0\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle with low-impact exercise, getting plenty of rest, enough sleep, and a healthy diet and weight are simple ways to prevent a recurrence.\u00a0\nAmong the lifestyle changes, diet plays an important role. A large proportion of the diet must contain fiber, which facilitates proper movement of the bowels, thereby enhancing the digestive capacity and reducing low back compression.\u00a0\nGreen leafy vegetables and fruits such as apples and bananas should be essential to your diet, providing vitamins that nourish the nerve roots. Heavy meals should be avoided as they take a long time to digest.\u00a0\nThis might put on undue pressure on the lower back region.\nIt is always advised to avoid foods rich in trans fat, gluten, excess salt, and sugars.\u00a0\nWhole grains, Flax seeds, spinach, carrot, cabbage, cucumber, black beans, ladies\u2019 finger, tomatoes, banana, orange, lemon, honey, raisins, fatless cottage cheese, coconut oil, and fish oil, should be included in the diet.\u00a0\nDrinking plenty of water is recommended.\u00a0\nQuitting smoking is another critical change to be made to prevent not only sciatica but also other deadly diseases.\nHow Can\u00a0 Our Treatment Helps You to Recover?\u00a0\nAyurvedic Treatment can do wonders in these cases rather than consuming NSAIDs and steroids for extended periods. Addressing the underlying source of the issue rather than merely treating the symptoms provides a holistic strategy to treat the condition. Ayurvedic disc bulge therapy focuses on herbal remedies, massages, yoga poses, and lifestyle adjustments to effectively relieve the pain and discomfort it causes.\nBook an \nAppointment\n with the\n best Ayurvedic hospital in Kerala\n\u00a0\n \nMake an Enquiry\n \nEnquiry Form\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nName \n*\nEmail \n*\nNumber\nSubject \n*\nComment or Message \n*\nSubmit"}

So, individuals with a family history are more prone to develop this condition.\n Abnormal processing of pain: The central nervous system communicates with the rest of the body through specialized cells called neurons. Any change or abnormalities in this communication may explain fibromyalgia and extreme sensitivity and sensitivity to pain.\n Infections: People affected with diseases, including Epstein-Barr virus and Lyme virus, are at more risk of developing fibromyalgia.\nPhysical trauma, including accidents or significant surgeries.\nSleep disturbance and neuroendocrine abnormalities.\nPsychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, etc\n \nBody Parts Affected by Fibromyalgia\n \nEven though fibromyalgia can cause pain and discomfort throughout the body, the common body parts affected by fibromyalgia are:\nHead\nThe Chest\nThe Abdomen\nArms and legs\nThe Upper back and spine\nThe Lower back and spine, including the buttocks\n \nTender Points in Fibromyalgia\u00a0\n \nTender points are specific sites in the affected person\u2019s body that are more likely to be more painful when pressed. \nThese regions are about the size of a penny and much more sensitive than the surroundings.

Disorders commonly associated with fibromyalgia include:\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\nIrritable bladder\nHeadaches, including migraine headaches\nDysmenorrhea\nPremenstrual Syndrome\nRestless Leg Syndrome\nTemporomandibular joint pain\nNon-cardiac chest pain\nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon\nChronic fatigue syndrome\nAnxiety and depression\nRheumatic conditions, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis\n \nHow To Diagnose Fibromyalgia\nThere are no diagnostic tests or imaging tools for fibromyalgia so far. \nTo be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, an individual must have experienced widespread pain, tenderness, and other associated symptoms for more than three months.\nOnce the person experiencing the symptoms approaches the healthcare provider, they will conduct a physical examination and medical history to identify the symptoms of fibromyalgia. \nThe physician will ask about the pain\u2019s duration, severity, and location, as well as whether you suffer from severe fatigue, memory issues, or disturbances in sleep.\nPhysical examination is carried out to examine the joints for swelling and deformity and to understand the location of the tender points. \nBlood, urine, and other imaging tests are also carried out to rule out other diseases and conditions. \nIf no alternative diagnosis is found, the condition is considered fibromyalgia.\n \nAyurvedic perspective on Fibromyalgia\nIn Ayurveda, the three fundamental energies or doshas \u2013 Vata, Pitta, and Kapha- are responsible for the body\u2019s normal functioning. \nAny imbalance or disturbance in these doshas can result in abnormal bodily functions and various health conditions.\nAyurveda describes fibromyalgia as the vitiation of Vata dosha, classifying it under the broad category of diseases known as Vata Vyadhi. \nThe symptoms of fibromyalgia closely resemble those explained in diseases such as\u00a0 \u2018Mamsadhathu gata Vata\u2019 or \u2018Mamsavruta Vata.\u2019\nThe vata dosha can get vitiated due to various factors such as inadequate rest, improper lifestyle and diet, chronic stress, emotional distress, etc.\u00a0 An imbalanced Vata dosha can destabilize the nervous system, leading to symptoms like widespread pain, stiffness, sleep disturbances, and abdominal bloating, which are characteristic of fibromyalgia.\nAdditionally, as per Ayurveda, the accumulation of toxins or ama is another factor responsible for the formation of the disease. \nThese accumulated toxins block the bodily channels (\nshrotoavarodh\n) and trigger the development of fibromyalgia.\n \nHow To Diagnose Fibromyalgia In Ayurvedic Way\nAyurvedic sages diagnose fibromyalgia by focusing on the involvement of doshas and dhatus. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed in Ayurvedic way by:\nPrakriti Assessment: Ayurveda explains the concept of Prakriti or individual constitution. Assessing prakriti helps people determine an individual\u2019s inherent strengths and weaknesses, which can influence how fibromyalgia manifests.\nDosha Imbalance: Fibromyalgia is often associated with an imbalance in Vata dosha, leading to symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and hypersensitivity.\nPhysical examination: Ayurvedic practitioners evaluate symptoms specific to fibromyalgia, such as widespread pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, and sensitivity to touch.\nUnderstanding Disease Pathogenesis: Ayurveda views fibromyalgia as a result of impaired digestion, which leads to the accumulation of ama and vitiation of Vata dosha. \nThis\n will help in planning treatment strategies focused on restoring digestive function, eliminating toxins, and balancing doshas.\nDifferential Diagnosis: Ayurvedic physicians differentiate fibromyalgia from other musculoskeletal disorders and systemic conditions based on symptom patterns and examination findings.\n \nRisk Factors And Complications\nRisk factors\nUnderstanding the risk factors of fibromyalgia can help with the diagnosis and management of the condition effectively. \nAlthough the exact cause of fibromyalgia is still unknown, several factors may increase the risk of developing the condition.\n1\n. Age\n: Fibromyalgia can affect people of any age, even in children. It most commonly affects people in middle age, and the chance of having it increases with age.\n2. \nGender\n: Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than men. It is partly due to hormonal imbalance or varying responses to stress or pain. Menopause is another potential risk factor for fibromyalgia in females due to the lower levels of estrogen hormone.\n3.\n Family History:\n Individuals having a close family member affected by the condition are more likely to develop the condition.\n4. \nStress and trauma\n: Physical or emotional trauma, such as an accident or significant life changes, can trigger the onset of fibromyalgia.\n5.\n Rheumatic conditions\n affect joints, muscles, and bones. People diagnosed with the conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and SLE.\n6. \nInfections:\n Some infections have been linked to developing or worsening fibromyalgia symptoms.\n7. Fibromyalgia occurs among people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.\nComplications\nFibromyalgia not only affects physical health but also has a significant impact on the various aspects of life. \nThe complications associated with fibromyalgia include:\n1. Chronic pain: Persistent pain can interfere with daily activities and the overall quality of life, resulting in frequent hospitalization.\n2. Sleep disturbances: Fibromyalgia can result in sleep problems, including insomnia and non-restorative sleep.\n3. Mental health issues: Chronic pain and fatigue can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions.\n4. Cognitive impairments: Fibromyalgia can lead to memory problems, difficulty in concentration, and mental fatigue.\n5. Reduction in quality of life: Constant discomfort can significantly impact personal and professional life, leading to decreased productivity and social isolation.\nFibromyalgia is not life-threatening but can be challenging. Learning how to manage the condition may give a better outcome\n \nAyurvedic Treatment For Fibromyalgia\nAyurveda offers a holistic approach to managing fibromyalgia. \nAyurvedic therapies focus on restoring bodily harmony, reducing pain, eliminating toxins, and enhancing the overall health of the affected individual. \nThey help balance the vitiated doshas, especially the vata dosha, and eliminate accumulated toxins from the body.\nInternal Medications\nAccording to Ayurveda, therapeutic plans can be classified into Sodhana(purification therapies) and Samana (pacifying medicines). \nInternal medications or Samana Chikitsa help balance the vitiated doshas, \nkindling\n the digestive fire, and \nrelieving\n pain and associated symptoms.\nAfter careful examination, various formulations are administered internally, considering the \ndoshic\n constitution, age, and progression of the disease. \nThese formulations commonly contain herbs with vata-pacifying properties, such as Ashwagandha, Guggulu, boswellia, Licorice, and Ginger.\nExternal Therapies\nPanchakarma therapies form the backbone of Ayurvedic therapeutic plans. These therapies balance the aggravated doshas, eliminate accumulated toxins, and restore mental harmony. Various therapeutic approaches for fibromyalgia are:\nAbhyanga\n, or full-body massage, with medicated \noils\n helps balance the Vata dosha, improves blood circulation, relaxes joints and muscles, relieves pain, and eases emotional distress. Physicians select oils with Vata-pacifying properties after analyzing the doshic constitution, age, and progression of the disease.\nSwedana\n or fomentation therapies aim to open the bodily channels and eliminate the accumulated toxins from the body.\nVasti\n, or medicated enema, is renowned in Ayurveda as the \u2018Ardha Chikitsa\u2019. Introducing medicated oil or decoction to the rectum helps pacify Vata dosha and enhance digestive health.\nShirodhara\n, the therapy in which warm medicated oil is poured gently over the head, helps balance Vata dosha, improves sleep quality, reduces anxiety, and enhances the functioning of the nervous system.\nNasyam\n, or instilling medicated oil through the nostrils, clears the nasal passage and aids in relieving symptoms of the head region.\nPizhichil \nis an Ayurvedic therapy in which warm medicated oil is poured over the body in a synchronized manner. This treatment benefits the body and muscles by relaxing them overall.\n \nRisk Factors And Complications\nRisk factors\nUnderstanding the risk factors of fibromyalgia can help with the diagnosis and management of the condition effectively. \nAlthough the exact cause of fibromyalgia is still unknown, several factors may increase the risk of developing the condition.\n1\n. Age\n: Fibromyalgia can affect people of any age, even in children.

However, early diagnosis and consistent adherence to Ayurvedic principles are necessary for effective management.\n \nWhat is gastritis?\nGastritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach, and it is usually caused by excessive alcohol consumption or prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. \nIt may also develop after major surgery, traumatic injury, burns, or severe infections. \nGastritis\n may also occur in those who have had weight loss surgery, resulting in the banding or reconstruction of the digestive tract. \nChronic causes are infection with bacteria, primarily Helicobacter pylori, chronic bile reflux, and stress; certain autoimmune disorders may also lead to gastritis. \nSymptoms of Gastritis\nPain: Patients of the acute abdomen experience severe pain in the upper abdomen; the pain may be dull, vague, burning, aching, gnawing, sore, or sharp\nNausea\nVomiting- if present, may be clear, green or yellow, blood-streaked, or completely bloody, depending on the severity of the stomach inflammation.\nBelching, if present, usually does not relieve the pain much.\nBloating\nEarly satiety\nLoss of appetite\nUnexplained weight loss \nCauses\nExcessive consumption of spicy or junk food.\nEating habits like skipping meals or eating late at night.\nMental stress.\nLong-term use of pain relievers or NSAIDs.\nExcessive intake of alcohol, smoking, or caffeinated beverages.\nProlonged fasting or irregular eating patterns.\nRisk factors\nObesity\nPregnancy\nHiatus hernia\nUse of NSAIDs like aspirin\nConsumption of caffeinated and carbonated drinks\nSmoking\nFatty and junk foods\nSleeping immediately after meals\nAssociated diseases of Gastritis\nPeptic and duodenal ulcers and associated bleeding\nPernicious anemia\nDiabetes\nThyroid disorders\nAddison\u2019s disease\nIron deficiency anemia\nDuodenitis\nMal-absorption\nPerforation\nEsophageal regurgitation\nEsophagitis\nBarrett\u2019s esophagus\nAspiration pneumonia\nTooth decay\nHeadache\nBackache\nEsophageal and stomach cancer\nAyurvedic perspective on gastritis\nIn Ayurveda, gastritis is often referred to as Urdhwaga Amla Pitta, ie.., a\n \ndisease involving upward movement of pitta in the body. \nAn imbalance of Pitta Dosha characterizes this disease. \nThe elements of Fire and Water govern the humor; these, in turn, govern the digestive fire and stomach enzymes. \nThis\n is why people of Pitta body constitution (Pitta Prakriti) usually suffer from hyperacidity, heartburn, peptic ulcers, etc. Factors that aggravate the Pitta dosha, like stress, anger, hot and spicy foods, and the scorching environment, can add to acidity. \nWhile Pitta is usually the victim blamed for acid indigestion, the Kapha dosha too can be a significant factor that has its abode in the stomach and the chest region. \nAs Kapha dosha controls the digestive juices and generates mucus, indigestion that buds from low metabolism and mucus congestion are common in acid reflux.\nYou can identify mucus-rich acid reflux if you are feeling sluggishness, a bitter taste in your mouth after your late-night meals and hunger pangs, chest congestion, especially in the morning, a heavily coated tongue, and a tendency to pile on weight.\nWhen to see a doctor\nYou need to consult a doctor if you experience the following symptoms consistently for a week or more:\nPersistent and severe abdominal pain and discomfort\nVomiting blood or coffee-ground-like material\nBlack or tarry stools\nUnexplained weight loss\nSevere bloating and indigestion\nHow to diagnose Gastritis?\nDetailed medical history and physical examination.\nEndoscopy to assess the stomach lining.\nBlood tests to check for H. pylori infection or anemia.\nStool tests for hidden blood.\n \nDifferent types\nType A Gastritis\n (Autoimmune):\nPredisposes to gastric cancer and pernicious anemia.\nType B Gastritis\n (H. pylori-related)\nPredisposes \nto\n peptic ulcers, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and gastric cancer.\nAddress underlying causes, such as infections or drugs.\nReflux Gastritis\nOccurs following a cholecystectomy or a gastric surgery\nUsually does not give rise to peptic ulcer disease\nErosive Gastritis\n\u00a0Occurs due to the overuse of NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs)\nAffects \nentire\n stomach\nOccurs due to defective gastric mucosal barrier\nGastritis can also be classified based on the chronicity of the disease into acute and chronic:\nAcute Gastritis\nCauses\n:\nChemicals (strong acids or alkalis)\nDrugs (e.g., salicylates, indomethacin)\nAlcohol, radiation, stress, shock, hypoxia, renal failure\nSymptoms\n:\nUpper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena.\n\u00a0\nTreatment\n:\nRemove the cause, bland diet, antacids, and fluid/electrolyte correction.\nChronic Gastritis\nThis type of gastritis can be atrophic or non-atrophic. The most common cause of atrophic chronic gastritis is autoimmune gastritis, while a Helicobacter pylori infection often causes non-atrophic chronic gastritis. It can be further classified into: \nChronic Superficial Gastritis\nCellular infiltration (lymphocytes and plasma cells) in the lamina propria.\nAffects the body and fundus of the stomach.\nChronic Atrophic Gastritis\nAssociated with\n: Pernicious anemia, diabetes, thyroid disorders, Addison\u2019s disease, and iron deficiency anemia\nComplications\n: Increased risk of gastric carcinoma.\nGranulomatous Gastritis\nSeen in diseases like tuberculosis, Crohn\u2019s disease, sarcoidosis, and syphilis.\nTreating the underlying condition can help manage this condition\nEosinophilic Gastritis\nEosinophilic infiltration of the gastric mucosa and peripheral blood.\nAssociated with parasitic infestations like \nAnisakis marina\n.\n\u00a0\nHypertrophic Gastritis\nEnlarged gastric folds.\nVarieties\n:\nM\u00e9n\u00e9trier\u2019s Disease\n:\nGastric juice is low in acid, and high in protein; it leads to hypoproteinemia.\nHyperacidity Variant\n: Gastric acid-rich gastric juice can be treated with H2 blockers or PPIs.\nWhat are the Different stages of Gastritis?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe \nOLGA (\nOperative Link on Gastritis Assessment\n)\n system evaluates atrophy in the stomach based on the degree of glandular loss and its distribution. Atrophy is scored \nin\n a \nfour-tier scale (0-3)\n and staged by combining atrophic changes in the parts of \nstomach\n, viz\n..\n \nantrum\n and \ncorpus\n.\nAtrophy Scoring (0-3)\nScore 0\n: No atrophy\nScore 1\n: Mild atrophy (with or without metaplasia)\nScore 2\n: Moderate atrophy\nScore 3\n: Severe atrophy\nStages Based on Scores\nNo Atrophy (Score 0)\u00a0 \nStage 0\n: No atrophy in any region.\nMild Atrophy (Score 1) \nAntrum\n:\nStage I (mild changes in antrum and incisura angularis).\nCorpus\n:\nStage I or Stage II (depending on combined severity).\nModerate Atrophy (Score 2) \nAntrum\n:\nStage II or Stage III (including incisura angularis).\nCorpus\n:\nStage II or Stage III (moderate changes in oxyntic mucosa).\nSevere Atrophy (Score 3)\nAntrum\n:\nStage III or Stage IV (severe glandular loss, including incisura angularis).\nCorpus\n:\nStage IV (marked atrophy in oxyntic mucosa).\nAtrophy is the loss of appropriate glands in the mucosa, with or without metaplasia. The overall stage results from the combined atrophic scores of these compartments.\nAyurvedic Treatment For Gastritis\u00a0\nGastritis has become a widespread problem in the present scenario due to unhealthy food habits and regimens. \nThe prolonged exposure to incompatible diets and habits may lead to gastric ulcers, chronic gastritis,\u00a0 duodenitis,\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome, malabsorption, anemia, and stenosis. \nAs in this disease, vitiated Pitta dosha and changes in the function of \nagni\n (appetite) are the primary causes. \nHence, the drugs incorporated here help pacify the Pitta dosha and stabilize the Kapha dosha.\u00a0 \nThese drugs work on subjective symptoms and physical, mental, and\n \nemotional health. \nIn Ayurveda, the treatment is done in two ways: samshamana and samshodhana. \nSamshodhana therapy includes panchakarma procedures such as virechana (Purgation) and vamana (emetic therapy) that help uproot sour belchings and associated symptoms. \nSamashama Therapy includes all the internal medicines that should be used prior to consulting the doctor. \nSamshamana Therapy\nThis\n includes internal medications; a wide range of ayurvedic natural antacids such as shankha dravaka, mukta pishti, guluchyadi kashayam, etc, are available in the market, which can be consumed as per the suggestion of your healthcare provider.\nSamshodhana (Panchakarma) Therapies\nVirechana (Purgation Therapy)\n:\n\u00a0Removes excess \nPitta\n and detoxifies the digestive system.\nVamana (Emetic therapy):\nEmetic therapy is the primary therapy mentioned in Ayurvedic classics for the management of Gastritis. It restores the natural \nkapha\n dosha and pulls out excess pitta dosha from the body.\nAsthapana Vasthi (Decoction enema):\n\u00a0It is indicated in chronic cases of gastritis where associated diseases are prevalent.\nTakradhara (Buttermilk Therapy)\n:\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A cooling therapy where medicated buttermilk is poured over the forehead to reduce Pitta.\nHerbs and formulations \nSingle Herbs\nShatavari (Asparagus \nracemosus\n):\nHelps reduce the inflammation of \ninternal\n lining of \nstomach\nLicorice (Yashtimadhu)\n:\n Protects and soothes the stomach \nlining,\n with anti-ulcer activity.\nAmla (Emblica officinalis)\n: \nActs\n as a cooling agent and rejuvenator along with its rich vitamin C content.\n\u00a0\nGuduchi (Tinospora cordifolia)\n: \nCan help control inflammation and support detoxification.\nNeem (Azadirachta indica)\n: \nCools the system and controls Pitta aggravation.\nFormulations\nAvipathi Churna\n\u00a0Balances Pitta and soothes the stomach lining.\nLaghu Sutshekhar Ras\n\u00a0Aids in digestion and relieves gastritis symptoms.\nKamdudha Ras:\nReduces acidity and inflammation.\nShankha Bhasma\n\u00a0Neutralizes stomach acid.\nGuluchyadi Kashayam:\n Anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.\nMukta Pishti\n: \nA pearl-based formulation that acts as a natural antacid.\nSutshekhar Ras No.1 (with Gold):\nActs as an alterative, antacid, and carminative and balances Pitta dosha\nAmlapittantak Yog\nUseful in stomach burn, this formulation acts as an antacid, carminative, and appetite enhancer. It can help ease discomfort from heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and indigestion while supporting appetite. \nAyurvedic Treatment for associated diseases of Gastritis?\nOther conditions due to pitta imbalance in the whole body system often accompany gastritis. \nHere are a few Ayurvedic approaches for associated diseases:\nAcid Reflux (GERD)\nHerbal Remedies\n:\n\u00a0\nShatavari (Asparagus \nracemosus\n)\n: \nReduces acid and soothes the stomach lining.\nLicorice (Yashtimadhu)\n:\n Protects the mucosal lining.\nDiet\n: \nspicy, fried, and fermented foods; include cooling foods like coconut water and buttermilk.\nHyperacidity\nHerbal Remedies\n:\nGuduchi (Tinospora cordifolia)\n:\nReduces inflammation.\nAmla (Emblica officinalis)\n:\n A natural antacid that promotes healing.\nDiet\n:\nLukewarm water with honey; avoid caffeine and acidic foods.\nUlcers (Peptic or Duodenal)\nHerbal Remedies\n:\nAloe Vera Juice\n:\nHeals the gastric mucosa.\nPippali (Long Pepper)\n\u00a0Supports digestion without aggravating Pitta.\nPanchakarma Therapies\n: \nVirechana (\nPurgation\n therapy) to cleanse excess Pitta.\nIndigestion and Bloating\nHerbal Remedies\n:\nHing (Asafoetida)\n:\n Reduces bloating and gas.\nCumin and Coriander Tea\n: \nIt supports digestion and soothes acidity.\nLifestyle\n:\nEat meals on time, chew food thoroughly, and avoid overeating.\nHeartburn \nHerbal Remedies\n:\nAvipattikar Churna\n: \nAvipathi Churna is a classical Ayurvedic formulation to help control acidity.\nGokshura (Tribulus Terrestris)\n: \nGokshura Supports healthy digestion.\nDiet\n:\nConsume small, frequent meals with cooling properties.\nNausea and Vomiting \nHerbal Remedies\n:\nMint (Pudina)\n:\nMint Provides relief from nausea.\nGinger (Shunthi)\n:\nGinger Calms the stomach.\nTherapies\n: \nShirodhara\n(Oil pouring therapy) for calming Pitta-related nausea.\nBurning Sensation\nHerbal Remedies\n:\n\u00a0\nChandanadi Churna\n: \nChandanadi churna has a Cooling effect on the body.\nPatola (Trichosanthes dioica)\n: \nDetoxifies and balances Pitta.\nTherapies\n:\nTakradhara\n(medicated buttermilk therapy) for cooling.\nHeadache and Migraine (Pitta-Related)\nHerbal Remedies\n:\nBrahmi (Bacopa monnieri)\n: \nReduces stress and cools Pitta.\nAshwagandha (Withania somnifera)\n:\n Balances stress-induced symptoms.\nTherapies\n: \nNasya\n(Nasal administration) with cooling oils like Brahmi oil/ Ksheerabla oil.\nDiet For Gastritis\u00a0\nFoods to Include:\nCooling foods such as coconut water, cucumber, and\n \nsweet fruits like pomegranate and banana.\nInclude easily digestible grains: Rice, barley, wheat.\nWarm milk with a pinch of licorice or Shatavari powder.\nVegetables like Ashgourd, Bitter gourd, Bottle gourd, Pumpkin, Cucumber\nFruits like gooseberry, black grapes, fig, dry grapes\nAdequate fluids like amla \njuice,\n \npomegranate\n\u00a0 juice\nOpt for light meals like porridge, khichdi, and steamed vegetables.\nConsume coconut water, fennel seeds, and honey\nFoods to Avoid:\nAvoid tea, coffee, carbonated, and alcoholic beverages.\nSteer clear of spicy, fried, sour, and fermented foods.\nAvoid pickles, fermented foods, and citrus fruits.\nLifestyle Recommendations for Gastritis Patients\nAvoid lying down immediately after meals.

Kidney diseases are often associated with imbalances in Kapha and Vata doshas. Ayurvedic treatments focus on restoring balance through:\nHerbal Medicines\n: Specific herbs like Punarnava, Gokshura, and Varun are known to support kidney health.\nPanchakarma Therapies\n: Detoxification therapies help eliminate toxins (ama) and rejuvenate kidney function.\nRasayana (Rejuvenation Therapies)\n: These therapies prevent disease progression and strengthen kidney tissues.\nDiet and Lifestyle Changes\n: Tailored recommendations help reduce the burden on kidneys and support recovery.\n \nAim of Ayurvedic treatments for Kidney diseases\nThe primary aim of Ayurvedic treatments for kidney diseases is to:\nAddress the Root Cause\n: Treat underlying imbalances in the doshas.\nEnhance Kidney Function\n: Improve filtration and detoxification capabilities.\nPrevent Progression\n: Delay the onset of complications and the need for invasive interventions like dialysis.\nSupport Overall Health\n: Improve energy, immunity, and quality of life through holistic care.\n \nWhat are the different types of kidney diseases?\nChronic kidney disease (CKD)\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) results from progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function.\nIt may progress over time without any symptoms until the function of the kidneys becomes very minimal. Kidney failure is considered the most serious outcome of CKD.\nPer year, over 1 lakh patients are diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease in India.\nAlbuminuria is a hallmark of progressive chronic kidney disease and the earliest marker of glomerular disease, generally appearing before the reduction in GFR.\nIt manifests initially as a biochemical abnormality; eventually, the kidney\u2019s excretory, metabolic, and endocrine dysfunctions lead to the development of clinical symptoms and signs of renal failure, which are referred to as uremia.\nThe disease has multiple etiologies and forms a vast clinical spectrum of symptomatology.\nCKD is a global threat to health in general and to developing countries in particular because treatment therapy is expensive and should be continued lifelong.\nIn most cases, CKD is initially asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is often made based on routine investigations.\nOnce symptomatic, it clinically presents as oliguria/ anuria, severe anemia, renal edema, uremic vomiting, etc.\nThe available treatment modalities in conventional systems of medicine are still evolving, and hemodialysis and renal transplantation are the final steps.\nAcute Kidney Injury (AKI)\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of renal function resulting in the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) and/or decreased urine output.\nAcute kidney injury/failure is a result of renal or extra-renal surgery, bacterial infection, and nephrotoxicity and is more commonly seen in hospitalized populations.\nIt is known to be a prime independent risk factor for mortality, with mortality rates of up to 10%.\nThis condition removes the kidneys\u2019 ability to filter waste products, balance fluids, and regulate electrolytes in the body.\nAKI is often reversible with prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment, but delays in care may lead to chronic kidney issues.\nKidney Stones\nKidney stones are hard mineral and salt deposits that form in the kidneys when there is a disbalance between water handling and solute clearance by the kidneys.\nThis results in urine becoming concentrated, allowing these substances to crystallize.\nThey can be clinically categorized into surgically active and medically active varieties.\nThe surgically active stone disease presents with severe pain, hematuria, or complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and may require endoscopic or surgical intervention.\nOn the other hand, multiple, recurrent, or growing stones are called medically active stones, often necessitating metabolic workup to elucidate an underlying cause.\nThey can vary in size and cause severe pain when passing through the urinary tract.\nCommon symptoms include sharp pain in the back or side, blood in the urine, nausea, and frequent urination.\nFactors such as dehydration, diet, and genetics increase the risk of kidney stones.\nTreatment ranges from increased hydration and pain management to surgical intervention in severe cases.\nGlomerulonephritis\nGlomerulonephritis is a kidney disease characterized by inflammation of the tiny kidney filters (glomeruli).\nThe excess fluid and waste that glomeruli remove from the bloodstream exit the body as urine.\nIt can occur as a primary kidney condition or as a result of systemic diseases like lupus or infections.\nSymptoms may include puffiness of the face, swelling in the legs, reduced urine output, blood in urine, high blood pressure, and even kidney failure. Early intervention is crucial to prevent long-term damage.\nPolycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)\nIt is an inherited genetic disorder characterized by the presence of innumerable cysts of varying sizes in both kidneys.\nThe patients are usually asymptomatic till 4th to 5th decade of life.\nThe usual presentation is hypertension, abdominal discomfort, and hematuria, which can be detected by the feeling of abdominal mass on ultrasonography (USG).\nComplications like urinary tract infection (UTI), cyst infections, cyst hemorrhage, renal calculi (commonly uric acid), and malignancy.\nThe renal cysts increase slowly over many years, and the renal function deteriorates gradually.\nPathologically, the kidneys are enlarged and can reach large sizes; the surface is riddled with various cysts.\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasonography, which shows enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts in both kidneys.\nThe number of cysts increases with the age of the patients.\nCysts in the liver, pancreas, and epididymis support the diagnosis of PKD. CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive in identifying small cysts but are often unnecessary for diagnosis, as USG can confirm.\nA minimum of 6 cysts in each kidney should be visible on the ultrasonogram.\nDiabetic Nephropathy\nDiabetic Nephropathy is a type of kidney damage resulting from long-term, uncontrolled diabetes. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to filter waste efficiently. Early symptoms include protein in the urine, swelling in the ankles or feet, and increased blood pressure. Managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels through diet, exercise, and medication is essential to slow the progression of the disease and prevent kidney failure.\nHypertensive Nephropathy\nHypertensive Nephropathy refers to kidney damage caused by chronic high blood pressure.\nElevated blood pressure can narrow and weaken the blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to function correctly.\nOver time, this can lead to scarring, kidney failure, or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Symptoms may not appear in the early stages but can include protein in the urine, swelling, and fatigue as the condition progresses. Controlling blood pressure through medication, diet, and exercise is critical for managing this condition.\nKidney Infections (Pyelonephritis)\nPyelonephritis is a type of bacterial infection that affects the kidneys, typically arising from a urinary tract infection (UTI) that spreads upwards. Symptoms include fever, chills, back or flank pain, nausea, and frequent or painful urination. If untreated, it can lead to permanent kidney damage or bloodstream infections (sepsis). Treatment usually involves antibiotics and, in severe cases, hospitalization for intravenous medication. Staying hydrated and promptly treating UTIs can help prevent kidney infections\n \nWhat are the pros and cons of Ayurvedic treatment for kidney diseases?\nPros of Ayurvedic Treatment for Kidney Diseases.\nAddresses the root cause\nFocuses on prevention of progression to end-stage\nMinimal side effects compared to conventional systems of medicine when diagnosed and administered correctly.\nCustomized treatment plans based on individual needs.\nSupports long-term wellness\nCons of Ayurvedic Treatment for Kidney Diseases\nA strict diet and lifestyle regime is necessary during the treatment course.\nLonger treatment duration compared to allopathic medicine.\nUnable to meet emergency conditions like severe acute kidney failure.\n \nSymptoms of kidney diseases\nThe early stages of Kidney Disease often have no noticeable symptoms and are usually identified through specific tests that measure kidney function (stages 1-3).\nAs the disease progresses, kidney failure can cause various symptoms, referred to as the \u201curemic state,\u201d which can affect almost any part of the body. However, the severity of symptoms doesn\u2019t always match the severity of kidney damage. Here is a list of common symptoms:\nSwelling (edema) in the feet, ankles, or hands\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nFatigue and weakness\nFrequent urination, especially at night\nReduced urine output\nBlood in the urine (haematuria)\nFoamy or bubbly urine\nPersistent itching\nLoss of appetite and nausea\nDifficulty concentrating\nHeart and circulation problems\nChest pain and heart issues\nLoss of appetite (anorexia)\nNausea and vomiting\nConstipation or diarrhoea\nMouth and gum problems\nUremic frost\nRare complications (e.g., hiccups, ascites)\nNervous system and mental health effects (neuropsychiatric symptoms)\nNerve issues (tingling, numbness, weakness, itching, restless leg syndrome)\nMood and behavior changes\nRed, irritated eyes (uremic red eyes)\nCalcium deposits in the eye (band keratopathy)\nAnaemia\nBleeding problems\nRenal osteodystrophy (hyper parathyroid bone disease, osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, calciphylaxis)\nGrowth retardation (in children)\nPulmonary edema\nPleural effusion and pleurisy\nMetabolic acidosis\nChronic malnutrition\nSexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, azoospermia, menstrual irregularities)\nCauses of Kidney Diseases\nKidney diseases can result from various factors, including:\nPrimary Diseases: \nGlomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, Glomerulosclerosis\nSecondary Diseases:\n Diabetes and Hypertension.\nTubular Diseases: \nReflux nephropathy, obstructive uropathy\nVascular Diseases: \nHypertensive nephrosclerosis, Ischemic nephropathy, vasculitis\nCystic Diseases: \nPolycystic kidney disease,\nInfections\n: Recurrent urinary tract infections.\nHemolytic anemia\nMicroangiopathy\nMedications and Toxins\n: Long-term use of NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, and exposure to heavy metals.\nDehydration\n: Chronic low fluid intake.\nObstruction\n: Kidney stones or enlarged prostate blocking urine flow.\nRisk factors of Kidney Diseases\nAging\nFamily history of CKD\nSmoking\nReduced renal mass\nRacial factors\nLow birth weight\nDiabetes\nPoor glycemic control\nHypertension-uncontrolled\nInfections\nObstructions\nDrug-toxicity\nHypersensitivity\nProteinuria\nMetabolic disorders\nAnemia\nAcidosis\nWhen to see a doctor\nIt is crucial to seek medical attention if you experience:\nPersistent swelling in extremities.\nDifficulty or pain during urination.\nChanges in urine color, nature, or output.\nSevere fatigue and difficulty concentrating.\nHigh blood pressure that is difficult to control.\nUnexplained weight loss\n \nDiagnosis of Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Simplified Points\nEarly Detection Challenges\n:\nCKD often remains undetected until it reaches advanced stages.\nStrong clinical suspicion and timely investigations are essential for early diagnosis.\nKey Diagnostic Markers\n:\nDecreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)\n or markers of kidney damage confirm CKD.\nSerum Creatinine\n:\nPoor indicator of kidney function; significant increase occurs only after GFR falls below 50%.\nEstimated GFR (eGFR)\n:\nCalculated using formulas like Cockcroft-Gault, which are simple and reliable.\nMarkers of Kidney Damage\n:\nProteinuria\n: Excess protein in the urine.\nMicroscopic Haematuria\n:\nMore than five red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field in urine suggests kidney damage.\nDysmorphic RBCs and acanthocytes often indicate glomerular disease.\nUrinary Casts\n: Proteinuria and cellular casts indicate renal parenchymal disease.\nUrinary Concentration Issues\n:\nFixed urinary specific gravity (~1.010) and osmolality (~290 mOsm/kg) suggest impaired kidney ability to concentrate or dilute urine.\nBlood Test Findings\n:\nElectrolytes and Metabolic Abnormalities\n:\nWhen GFR drops below 25 ml/min, there is low serum calcium and high phosphorus levels.\nHigh alkaline phosphatase (ALP) indicates bone involvement.\nReduced serum bicarbonate due to metabolic acidosis.\nHigh anion gap metabolic acidosis in severe CKD due to acid retention.\nPotassium Levels\n:\nUsually typical until advanced CKD (stage 4).\nHyperkalemia can occur early with excessive dietary Potassium, potassium-sparing drugs, or distal tubular dysfunction.\nImaging Findings\n:\nKidney Size\n: Smaller kidneys detected via ultrasound in longstanding CKD.\nSkeletal Changes\n:\nX-rays may reveal:\nRenal rickets in children.\nOsteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa, or osteosclerosis in adults.\nBy combining clinical symptoms, lab tests, and imaging, CKD can be identified and classified for appropriate management.\n \nAyurvedic Treatment for Kidney Diseases\nAyurvedic treatment for kidney diseases depends on the stage of the disease.\nCorrecting the metabolic processes and stimulating \nmetabolic fire\n is the first step towards healing.\nEarly stages are easily manageable with Ayurvedic renoprotective herbs and therapies; however, in a progressive stage, supportive management can be possible through Ayurveda.\nAccording to Ayurveda, chronic kidney disease is a disease of Mutravaha Srotas.\nThough all three Doshas are involved in the disease, \nKapha\n is the prime culprit responsible for blocking microvessels and developing microangiopathy.\nVata\n is responsible for the degeneration of the structure of the kidney. According to Ayurvedic principles of managing the disease, Rasayana drugs can prevent and repair tissue damage because they can improve tissue quality and increase tissue resistance.\nIt increases urine filtration, reduces swelling, and overcomes urination difficulty.\nOn the other hand, the blockage can be removed by drugs that possess scraping properties.\nTreatments like avapeedaka snehapans and niruha basti with renoprotective decoctions have also been beneficial.\n \nHerbs and formulations beneficial in kidney diseases\nHerbs:\nGokshura\nPunarnava\nVaruna\nBhumi Amalaki\nMoringa\nGiloy\nFormulations\nGokshuradi guggulu\nChandraprabha vati\nPrabhakar vati\nShiva gutika\nNarayan churna\nPunarnava mandoor\nShilajit\nNote: These herbs and formulations are to be used under medical supervision only\nAyurvedic Tips to Improve Kidney Functions\nAvoid suppressing urinary urges at any time.\nDo not indulge in excessive exercise.\nLimit excessive intake of fish and fish products.\nAvoid high-potency medications\nDo not indulge in excessive use of concentrated alcohol.\nAvoid prolonged time sitting and moving in a spread vehicle.\nCut down your intake of highly processed foods, which are loaded with sugar and sodium.\nDrink adequate water and increase levels of physical activity.\nUnhealthy food choices and a sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of kidney disease, with obesity being a significant contributing factor.\nTips for those diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease\nTake proper medication for hypertension and diabetes\nCheck for anemia frequently by monitoring hemoglobin levels and correcting it\nTake calcium supplements as per the doctor\u2019s advice\nReduce salt and water intake after being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease\nReduce protein intake after being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease\nUse Ayurveda medication if any swellings in feet or face as per Ayurveda physician\nMonitor Potassium and phosphate quarterly along with hemoglobin, urea, and creatinine in blood after being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease\nHyperkalemia is life-threatening, so limit the use of green vegetables in your diet\nBe active and fit always, and practice Yoga and meditation.\nPractice Yoga pranayama and ask for suitable poses to Ayurveda and yoga expert\nDos and Don\u2019ts\nDos:\nImprove your hydration levels; drink water whenever you feel the urge.\nAim for 8-10 glasses daily, but adjust according to your body\u2019s needs and climate.\nOpt for fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\nInclude kidney-friendly options like watermelon, cucumber, ginger, and coriander.\nEngage in moderate activities like Yoga, brisk walking, or swimming to improve circulation and maintain a healthy weight.\nEat at regular intervals, chew your food thoroughly, and avoid overeating.\nPanchakarma, a detoxification therapy in Ayurveda, can help eliminate toxins and rejuvenate the kidneys.\nControl your blood pressure and blood sugar.\nPractice Yoga and meditation regularly to get down and lose weight.\nTake less salt and saturated fat.\nTake good water(Iron, arsenic-free) for drinking and cooking.\nTake organic fruits, vegetables, and grains.\nAvoid fertilizers and pesticides in your kitchen garden.\nTreat chronic UTI and practice a safe sex life.\nDon\u2019ts:\nProcessed and packaged foods are often high in sodium, sugar, and preservatives, which can strain the kidneys.\nExcessive protein, especially from red meat, can overburden the kidneys.\nReduce consumption of carbonated drinks and artificial juices.\nMinimise added salt in your meals and opt for natural flavor enhancers like herbs and spices.\nBoth can dehydrate the body and strain kidney function.\nSeek medical advice if you experience symptoms like swelling, fatigue, or changes in urination.\nAyurvedic Diet for Kidney Diseases\nDiet plays a pivotal role in maintaining kidney health. According to Ayurveda, food should be fresh, seasonal, and balanced to support the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha). Below are dietary recommendations:\nConsume the appropriate kinds and quantities of protein. A low protein intake might weaken your skin, hair, and nails. However, consuming too much protein might increase kidney damage and strain them. This occurs because your kidneys filter waste materials produced when your body utilizes protein. You may need to change your protein intake to maintain your health and feel best.\nYou should consume a certain quantity of protein based on your health, activity level, and body size. Your physician and nutritionist may advise you to consume less or other kinds of protein.\nFind out from your physician and dietitian how much protein you should consume and which kinds are best for you.\nSelect the appropriate fats. To maintain your health, you must include some fat in your diet. Heart problems and weight gain can result from having too much fat. Reduce the amount of fat in your meals and, where possible, substitute healthy fats, such as olive oil.\nSelecting the appropriate fats is also a component of the DASH diet, which promotes heart health.\nOverconsumption of carbohydrates might result in weight gain. Whole grains and nutritious carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables are the most excellent options if you have renal disease. Sugar, honey, hard candies, soft drinks, and other sugary beverages are unhealthy carbohydrates.\nYou might also need to keep a close eye on how many carbohydrates you consume if you have diabetes. You may get additional information about the carbohydrates in your diet and how they impact your blood sugar levels from your dietician.\nConsume the appropriate number of calories. Calories provide your body with energy, much like gasoline. Your diet\u2019s protein, fat, and carbohydrates provide calories. Your age, gender, body size, and degree of activity all affect how many calories you require.\nYou should change the number of calories you consume to maintain a healthy weight. You may determine how many calories you should consume each day with the assistance of your physician and nutritionist.\nOpt for a low-sodium diet. Salt is an inevitable thing in everyone\u2019s diet. However, people with kidney disease must restrict salt intake. Though salt plays several crucial roles in how your body functions, you may maintain a healthy salt level by eating foods that naturally contain it.\nConsuming packaged meals and seasoning food with salt might result in an excessive sodium intake.\nAn excessive amount of salt can cause thirst and cause your body to retain water, which can cause edema and increase blood pressure. Your kidneys may sustain more significant damage, and your heart may have to work harder.\nWhen cooking, add flavor using herbs and spices. When preparing or eating meals, avoid adding salt.\nInstead of using canned veggies, go for fresh or frozen ones. Drain and rinse canned veggies to get rid of excess salt.\nEat less acidic foods. Limit your intake of foods that raise acidity, such as vinegar, tomatoes, and fermented foods.\nLifestyle Recommendations\nAyurveda emphasizes the importance of a disciplined lifestyle to maintain kidney health. Here are some tips:\nExercise regularly. Practice yoga poses such as Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Spinal Twist) and Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose), which improve kidney function by stimulating blood flow.\nMaintain a consistent sleep schedule.\nControl stress levels. High stress can affect kidney health. Incorporate meditation, mindfulness, and Ayurvedic therapies like Shirodhara for relaxation.\nLimit exposure to toxins and unnecessary medications. Avoid smoking and exposure to environmental pollutants.\nConclusion\nAyurveda offers a holistic approach to maintaining and improving kidney health through herbal remedies, panchakarma therapies, and dietary and lifestyle interventions.\nWhile it cannot replace medical treatments for advanced kidney conditions, it can be a complementary approach to prolong wellness. Regular health check-ups, staying hydrated, eating a balanced diet, and incorporating Ayurvedic lifestyle practices can significantly contribute to well-being. They can help reduce the risk of kidney-related ailments.\nFAQ\nIs Ayurvedic medicine suitable for the kidney?\nYes, Ayurvedic medicine can help support kidney health by addressing imbalances in the doshas and promoting detoxification. However, always take the advice of an experienced Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any treatment.\nCan Ayurveda cure kidney failure?\nNo, Ayurveda cannot cure kidney failure, but it may help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease when used alongside conventional treatments.\nCan Ayurvedic Treatment Help to Stop Dialysis?\nNo, Ayurvedic treatment cannot help stop dialysis. However, it can prolong the time before dialysis becomes necessary by supporting kidney function naturally.\nReferences\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3361922/\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5123830/\nhttps://www.jpmhh.org/html-article/22126\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/kidney-disease/prevention/index.html\nhttps://ayushdhara.in/index.php/ayushdhara/article/download/294/232/774"}

These include staying hydrated, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and managing stress. \nWhile Ayurveda may be effective in managing and preventing kidney stones, it is not a substitute for conventional medical treatment. \nIf you are experiencing symptoms of kidney stones, such as severe pain, blood in your urine, or difficulty urinating, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.\n\u00a0 The treatment involves:\nUsing herbal medicines to dissolve stones naturally.\nDetoxifying the body through Panchakarma therapies.\nRecommending dietary modifications to prevent stone formation.\nEncouraging a balanced lifestyle to maintain kidney health.\n \nWhat is a kidney stone?\nA kidney stone is a hard object that is made from chemicals in the urine. There are four types of kidney stones: calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, and cystine. \nA kidney stone may be treated with shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy or nephrolithotripsy. \nCommon symptoms include severe pain in the lower back, blood in your urine, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills, or urine that smells bad or looks cloudy.\nUrine has various wastes dissolved in it.\n When there is too much waste in too little liquid, crystals begin to form. The crystals attract other elements and join together to form a solid that will get larger unless it is passed out of the body with the urine. \nUsually, these chemicals are eliminated in the urine by the body\u2019s master chemist: the kidney. \nIn most people, having enough liquid washes them out \nor\n other chemicals in urine stop a stone from forming. \nThe stone-forming chemicals are calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate.\nAfter it is formed, the stone may stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract into the ureter. Sometimes, tiny stones move out of the body in the urine without causing too much pain. \nBut stones that don\u2019t move may cause a back-up of urine in the kidney, ureter, the bladder, or the urethra. \nThis\n is what causes the pain.\nThe kidney stone starts to hurt when it causes irritation or blockage. \nThis\n builds rapidly to extreme pain. \nIn most cases, kidney stones pass without causing \ndamage-but\n \nusually\n not without causing a lot of pain.\nPain relievers may be the only treatment needed for small stones. \nOther treatment may be needed, especially for those stones that cause lasting symptoms or other complications. In severe cases, however, surgery may be required.\nWhat is a kidney stone from an Ayurvedic perspective?\nKidney stone is referred to as \nAshmari \nor \nMutrashmari \nin Ayurveda .\nIt is considered to have formed when the aggravated vata and pitta \ndries\n up the kapha dosha, causing the latter to assume the shape of the stone. Though all three doshas are involved, \nashmari\n \nis considered a kapha-predominant disease. \nAncient literature claims improper diet and lifestyle and improperly performed panchakarma as the reasons for kidney stones. \nDietary causes include foods that are dehydrating to the body, taste spicy and salty, and are thirst-inducing.\n Along with this, excess exercise, lack of sleep, excessive walking, etc, are some of the habits that can cause kidney stones.\nWhat are the different types of kidney stones?\nKidney stones are classified based on their composition. Understanding the type of kidney stone assists in determining the cause and treatment options\nCalcium oxalate\nThis is\n the most common type of kidney stone (80%), \nwhich\n is created when calcium combines with oxalate in the urine.\n Inadequate calcium and fluid intake, as well as other conditions, may contribute to their formation. High oxalate foods (spinach, nuts, beets, chocolate), low water intake leading to concentrated urine, excessive vitamin D or calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, and\n \nmetabolic disorders are the major reasons behind forming calcium oxalate stones. Calcium stones can develop either as calcium oxalate crystals or calcium phosphate Stones\nUric acid: \nThis is the second most common type of kidney stone. It is formed when the urine is too acidic, causing uric acid to crystallise. A diet rich in high-purine-containing foods like red meat, shellfish, alcohol, and curd, gout or metabolic disorders, chronic dehydration, diabetes and obesity. High purine intake leads to a higher production of monosodium urate, which, under the right conditions, may form stones in the kidneys. The formation of these types of stones tends to run in families.\nStruvite\nThese are more common in women and often develop due to recurrent urinary tract infections. It is made of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate crystals. The urease-producing bacteria remains in the tract and makes the urine more alkaline. It can grow large and cause kidney damage.\nCystine: \nThese stones are rare and are hereditary. It can be caused by a genetic disorder called cystinuria, leading to excessive cystine in urine. Stones are large and recurrent.\nDrug-Induced Stones:\n These stones are mainly the result of certain medications, Indinavir (used for HIV treatment), excessive vitamin C or calcium supplements or diuretics leading to dehydration.\nEarly symptoms\nThe symptoms differ in accordance with the location of the calculus, but some of the commonly presented ones are:-\nPain- called renal colic, a sharp and intermittent pain that radiates from the loin to the groin\nNausea and vomiting\nThe urgency to urinate or pass urine in small quantities\nBurning sensation during urination\nUrinary tract infection (UTI)\nSymptoms at a \nlater\n stage\nIntense pain in the lower back, abdomen, or sides.\nBlood in urine or hematuria, as the descending stones scar the walls of the urethra. The urine will be red, rose, or brown, depending on the severity of the bleeding. The urine may appear cloudy with a foul smell in extreme cases.\nReferred pain\nSoreness\nBlocked urine flow.\nFever and chills in case of infection.\nCauses\nDehydration- when the body is deprived of enough water, it switches to survival mode by reabsorbing water from the urine. \nThis\n concentrates the urine and increases the risk of renal calculi.\nDietary factors- Consuming highly salted, artificially sweetened, protein-rich food for a long time can make you prone to kidney stones. Certain fruits like tomatoes also promote the same.\nCertain medicines- some mineral-based medicines, antacids, vitamin supplements, etc can trigger kidney stones.\nCertain health issues- such as IBS, cystinuria, impaired calcium metabolism, some surgeries, etc increase the chances of getting affected.\nObesity\nFamily history\nHistory of renal calculi- if you have a history of kidney stones, you are at risk of developing them further.\nRisk factors\nFamily history of kidney stones.\nHigh-protein or high-sodium diets.\nObesity and sedentary lifestyle.\nChronic digestive diseases or surgeries affecting calcium absorption.\nCertain medications \nleading\n to stone formation.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeek immediate medical attention when you experience:\nSevere and persistent pain.\nBlood in urine.\nFever and chills.\nDifficulty passing urine.\nDiagnosis\nThe following methods can be used to diagnose kidney stones:\n1. Medical History\nA detailed medical history helps identify risk factors such as:\nFamily history of kidney stones\nDietary habits (high oxalate, calcium, or protein intake)\nHydration levels and fluid intake\nHistory of urinary tract infections or metabolic disorders\n2. Laboratory Tests\nCertain urine and blood tests help determine the type and cause of kidney stones.\nUrine Tests\nUrinalysis\n \u2013 Checks for blood, infection, and stone-forming crystals.\n24-hour urine test\n \u2013 Measures levels of calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, and other minerals to determine risk factors.\nUrine culture\n \u2013 Identifies infection if UTI is suspected.\nBlood Tests\nSerum creatinine & blood urea nitrogen (BUN):\n Assess kidney function.\nSerum calcium and uric acid levels:\n High levels indicate a risk of calcium or uric acid stones.\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) test:\n Checks for hyperparathyroidism, a cause of calcium stone formation.\n3. Imaging Tests\nImaging helps confirm the presence, size, and location of kidney stones.\nCommon Imaging Techniques\nUltrasound (Renal Sonography):\nNon-invasive and radiation-free.\nDetects stones, hydronephrosis (swelling of kidneys), and obstructions.\nPreferred for pregnant women and children.\nX-ray (KUB \u2013 Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder X-ray):\nIdentifies large calcium-based stones but may miss smaller or non-calcium stones.\nCT Scan (Non-contrast Helical CT):\nGold\n standard for kidney stone diagnosis.\nDetects all stone types, even small ones.\nProvides precise stone size and location.\nIntravenous Pyelogram (IVP):\nUses contrast dye to visualize kidney function and blockages.\nLess commonly used due to CT scan availability.\nMRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):\nRarely used for stones but may be done to assess kidney function and surrounding structures.\n4. Stone Analysis\nIf the stone is passed naturally or removed surgically, a \nstone composition analysis\n is done to identify the type of stone (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, or cystine). \nThis\n helps in preventing future stone formation through targeted dietary and lifestyle modifications.\n \nAyurvedic treatment for kidney stone\nThe first and foremost step is to avoid the causative factors. For this, one can follow an Ayurvedic diet and routine and undergo timely panchakarma procedures. Several medicines that promote urinary output and dissolution of the calculi are also mentioned in Ayurvedic texts.\nMedicines\nSeveral remedies have been traditionally recommended for the treatment of \nashmari\n. \nThey may be classified into many classes based on their activity, such as \nmutrala\n (diuretics), \nbhedana\n (stone breakers), \nshothahara\n (Anti-inflammatory), \nvedanasthapana\n (pain relievers), \nvasti-shodhana\n (renal function enhancers), and so on.\n Medicines are accessible in a variety of forms, including \nchurna\n, \nghrita\n, and kashaya.\nPanchakarma Therapies\nPanchakarma therapies like daily purgation (Nitya Virechana) with Gandarvahastadi Eranda Taila, along with milk and Abhayadi Modaka, are found beneficial in kidney stones. \nUttarabasti (administering a medicinal oil or decoction into the urinary bladder) with Taila or ghee processed with lithotriptic drugs \nare\n beneficial. \nAnuvasana \nvasthi\n with Varunadya Taila, Vastamayantaka Gritha, Veeratharuvadi Gritha, Shatavaryadi Gritha, etc., also can be used. Niruhabasthi, like Ksharabasti and Eranda Moola Niroohabasti, also have an important role in Kidney stone treatment.\nDrink plenty of water\n.\nConcentrated urine is one of the causes of kidney stones. To avoid this, drink plenty of water. \nAvoid aerated and synthetic liquids and instead go for natural fluids like coconut water, buttermilk, lime juice, gooseberry juice, and so on. \nBarley water and water cooked with Punarnava (Boerhavia diffusa- Spreading Hogweed) or Gokshura (Tribulus Terrestris- Puncture vine) are both effective diuretics that may be made at home.\nAyurvedic dietary and lifestyle recommendations for kidney stones\nEnhance your water intake\nFavour fibre-rich food and leafy vegetables\nAvoid exercising beyond your limit\nDo panchakarma procedures on time under proper guidance\nPanchakarma procedures such as \nuttara basti \n(administering medicines through the urethra) can benefit the patient.\nVoid urine on time\nAvoid hot, sharp, pungent food substances such as pickles\nPractice Yoga\nYoga can relieve pain and facilitate the easy passage of stones. Consider performing them under the guidance of a qualified professional. Some of the commonly prescribed asanas are:\nPavanamuktasana\nUttanapadasana\nBhujangasana\nDhanurasana\nUshtrasana\nArdha Matsyendrasana\nNatural remedies\nHydration: Drinking plenty of water is crucial.4 It dilutes urine, making it harder for minerals to concentrate and form stones.5 Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water daily.6\nLemon Juice: Lemons contain citrate, which can inhibit stone formation.7 Drink lemon water regularly.\nApple Cider Vinegar: It may help dissolve some types of stones.8 Mix 1-2 tablespoons in water and drink it.9\nPomegranate Juice: It may help reduce the risk of stone formation due to its antioxidant properties\nLemon juice and honey: Drinking fresh lemon juice with warm water can help break down stones due to its citric acid content.\nCoconut water: Regular intake of coconut water with a few cardamom pods helps flush out toxins and prevent stone formation.\nBarley water (Yava Kashaya): It acts as a diuretic and helps reduce stone size.\nGokshura (Tribulus terrestris) tea: Known for its diuretic properties, it helps in stone elimination and urinary tract cleansing.\nPunarnava (Boerhavia diffusa): An effective herb that reduces swelling and supports kidney function\nCranberry Juice: Cranberry juices have acidic elements that help defoliate stones from the kidneys. But avoid it if you are having oxalate stones.\nFor pain relief, drink half a fresh lemon juice in 8 ounces of water every half an hour until the pain subsides. Alternate between lemon juice and apple juice. Drink at least 3 quarts of quality water daily to maintain good kidney function.\nIncreased consumption of foods rich in vitamin A is beneficial to the urinary tract and helps discourage the formation of stones. \nHerbs and formulations\nAyurveda advocates the use of several potent herbs and formulations for kidney stone management, including:\nHerbs\nGokshura (Tribulus terrestris):\n Helps break down kidney stones and reduce inflammation.\nVarun (Crataeva \nnurvala\n):\n Traditionally used to dissolve urinary calculi.\nPunarnava (Boerhavia diffusa):\n A natural diuretic that supports kidney health.\nPashanabheda (Bergenia \nligulata\n):\n Its name means \u201cstone breaker,\u201d indicating its effectiveness in dissolving kidney stones.\nFormulations\nChandraprabha Vati:\n A classical Ayurvedic formulation \nbeneficial\n for urinary tract health.\nGokshuradi guggulu:\n A traditional diuretic and pain relieving formulation\nKukkutandatvak Bhasma, Hajrul Yahood Bhasma:\n A mineral preparation used to break down stones.\nVeeratharadi Kashayam:\n A classical ayurvedic preparation containing diuretic herbs\nBrihatyadi Kashayam:\n A classical ayurvedic preparation containing diuretic and \npain relieving\n herbs\nVasthamayantakam Ghritam:\n This can be used for \navapeedaka\n \nsnehapana\n in kidney stone patients as it directly acts on the excretory system\nHow to prevent with natural methods\nThe risk of developing kidney stones (specifically calcium oxalate stones) may increase if you consume foods high in oxalate, as oxalate is a component of the most prevalent type of kidney stone. The body\u2019s and urine acid levels may increase if an individual consumes an excessive amount of animal proteins in their diet, such as beef, fish, and poultry. High levels of acidity promote the development of calcium oxalate and uric acid stones. The creation of uric acid from the breakdown of meat further increases the risk of developing calcium and uric acid stones. Here are \nfew\n natural ways to prevent the formation of kidney stones:\nIncrease your water \nintake,\n do not suppress your thirst\n, in\n \nfact\n avoid suppressing all your natural \nurges\nReduce \u2013 smoking, alcohol, packaged food, long meal gaps and long sitting \nhours\nFocus on \u2013 sleeping better, regular home-cooked food, hydration and \nexercise\nDrink tender coconut water mixed with cardamom pods once \nin\n a week to cleanse your excretory \nsystem\nReduce animal protein \nintake\nAvoid consuming excess spicy and tangy foods like \npickles\nInclude hydrating veggies and fruits like cucumbers, watermelon, pomegranates, apples \netc\n \nDiet For Kidney Stones\nA balanced diet plays a crucial role in preventing and managing kidney stones. \nKey dietary recommendations for kideny stone patients \nInclude increasing fluid intake (aim for at least 3 litres of water daily), \nInclude citrate-rich foods (lemon, oranges, and amla help prevent stone formation), \nReduce oxalate-rich foods (spinach, nuts, and chocolate should be limited), limit salt intake (excessive sodium can contribute to stone development),\nConsume calcium in moderation (opt for natural sources like sesame seeds and ragi), \nEat fiber-rich foods (whole grains, vegetables, and fruits help in better digestion and mineral absorption).\nFoods To Include In Diet\nEat enough dietary calcium. Three servings of dairy per day will help lower the risk of calcium stone formation. Eat with meals. If one does not acquire enough calcium, oxalate levels may increase. Calcium should be received via diet rather than supplements, which have been related to the formation of kidney stones.\nCalcium-rich foods include milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and a variety of cheeses. Vegetarian calcium sources include legumes, calcium-set tofu, dark green vegetables, nuts and seeds, and blackstrap molasses. If cow\u2019s milk is not an option, lactose-free milk, fortified soy milk, or goat\u2019s milk should be drunk instead\nMake sure to include vitamin D-rich foods in your regular diet. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption. Fatty fish like salmon, mushrooms, and cheese should be eaten.\nEat a moderate amount of protein. \nHigh protein \nintakes\n will cause the kidneys to excrete more calcium \ntherefore\n, \nthis\n may cause more stones to form in the kidney.\nPulses and sprouts: First soak, sprout and then cook pulses and sprouts before eating them in the right proportion. \nPulses like horse \ngram,\n \nkidney\n beans are considered beneficial.\nCitrus fruit and juice, which contain naturally occurring citrate, can help minimize or prevent the formation of stones.

Some people can live with mild symptoms for years.\nMuscle wasting and weakness of muscles and usually symmetrical tendon reflexes are usually preserved until a later stage.\nMuscular dystrophy is inherited in families.

Epilepsy, on the other hand, is characterized by repeated seizures that can result in loss of consciousness and convulsions.\nThe consequences of neurological diseases go beyond the physical signs. Individuals suffering from these illnesses frequently face emotional and psychological difficulties.\u00a0\nSeizures\n and chronic pain can be unexpected, resulting in worry, sadness, and social isolation.\u00a0\nIn certain circumstances, the side effects of \ntraditional therapy\n might aggravate these emotional difficulties.\u00a0\nAs a result, more people are turning to alternative treatments like Ayurveda for effective and comprehensive remedies.\nMajor neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke can have debilitating effects. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, offers natural treatments that may help relieve symptoms and slow the progression of some neurological disorders.\nParkinson\u2019s disease\u00a0\nParkinson\u2019s disease\n is one of the progressive disorders of the nervous system that primarily affects the movement of the body.\u00a0\nAyurvedic treatments aim to balance vata dosha, which governs movement in the body.\u00a0\nHerbal medicines\n containing mucuna pruriens, commonly known as velvet bean or cowhage, may help boost dopamine levels. \nMassage\n with medicated oils, heat treatments, and Yoga can also provide relief from stiffness and tremors.\n\u0391lzhiermers disease\n\u0391lzhimer\u2019s disease\n is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that destroys memory and cognitive abilities.\u00a0\nAyurvedic remedies focus on balancing vata and pitta doshas to improve mental functions.\u00a0\nHerbs like brahmi, ashwagandha, and turmeric may help boost memory, reduce inflammation in the brain, and slow the progression of the disease. Daily massage with coconut or almond oil, meditation, and mental exercises are also recommended.\nEpilepsy\nEpilepsy causes seizures resulting from abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\u00a0\nThe goal of \nAyurvedic treatment\n is to pacify vata dosha and balance nerve impulses.\u00a0\nHerbs such as brahmi, jatamansi, and vacha may help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.\u00a0\nA ketogenic diet, Yoga, meditation, and gemstone therapy are other recommended treatments.\nMultiple sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis or MS damages the protective covering of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0\nAyurveda aims to balance vata dosha, reduce inflammation, and boost the nervous system.\u00a0\nTreatments include \npanchakarma\n detoxification, herbal medicines such as ashwagandha and guggul, and daily oil massage.\u00a0\nYoga and pranayama breathing exercises can help improve flexibility, strength, and lung capacity.\nStroke\nA stroke, also known as a brain attack or cerebrovascular accident, occurs when the blood vessels supplying the brain get blocked or ruptured. In both cases, parts of the brain become damaged or die.\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\n (GBS) is a rare condition in which a person\u2019s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves.\u00a0\nPeople of all ages can probably be affected by this devastating disease at any stage of life, but it is more common in adults and males.\u00a0\nMost people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome through Ayurvedic therapies.\n \nAyurvedic Approach on Neurological Diseases\n \nAyurveda provides a distinct viewpoint on neurological illnesses by emphasizing harmony and balance and addressing the underlying causes of these conditions instead of merely treating their symptoms.\u00a0\nBy considering factors such as lifestyle, diet, and emotional well-being, Ayurveda enables one to restore the body\u2019s natural equilibrium.\nLet\u2019s check the Ayurvedic approach as a treatment for neurological problems and how Ayurvedic therapy, lifestyle changes, and herbal medicines may help control and even reduce the symptoms of certain diseases.\u00a0\nJoin us as we unleash the power of this ancient practice and its ability to improve lives, whether you are looking for other options or are simply curious about the possible advantages of Ayurveda.\n \nWhat is the nervous system?\n \nThe nervous system comprises two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).\u00a0\nThe central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of the cranial and spinal nerves. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), although functionally a separate system, is part central and part peripheral.\u00a0\nThe human brain, weighing about 1400 g and about 2% of the total body weight, consists of neurons and their connections.\u00a0\nIt is developed from ectoderm.\u00a0\nMost of the central nervous system develops in the first twelve weeks of embryogenesis.\nInfections in the mother or toxic causes lead to malformations of the nervous system if they occur during this period.\u00a0\nAll information concerning our body and the outside world is received centrally by the brain through the sensory pathways.\u00a0\nThe brain is concerned with all kinds of voluntary motor activity and regulation of visceral, endocrine, and bodily functions.\u00a0\nThe brain is also concerned with such higher mental functions as consciousness, thought, memory, attention, emotion, creative and imaginative ability, speech, and sleep.\n \nAyurvedic concept of the nervous system\n \nAyurveda considers Vata dosha as the main culprit behind all neurological disorders.\u00a0\nAn imbalance in Vata causes disharmony in the human body, which leads to neurological disorders.\u00a0\nSo, the main line of treatment lies in rectifying this Vata imbalance and bringing the Vata dosha back to harmony.\u00a0\nAlong with Vata dosha, Pitta and Kapha dosha also play a key role in causing the disease.\u00a0\nThere are over 600 known neurological disorders and conditions that affect the human nervous system, and for many of them, treatment options are minimal.\u00a0\nNow, Millions of people worldwide are affected chiefly by neurological disorders. Among the known neurological diseases, approximately 6.2 million people worldwide die solely because of stroke each year. More than 50 million people have epilepsy worldwide.\u00a0\nIt is approximately estimated that there are globally 35.6 million people with dementia and 7.7 million new cases every year.\u00a0\nAmong these, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia and may contribute to 60\u201370% of cases.\u00a0\nAlso, the prevalence of migraine is more than 10% worldwide.\n \nHow doshas connected with the nervous system\n \nVata Pradhan tridosha involvement has been necessary for the proper functioning of the Central Nervous System.\u00a0\nThe dosha bheda\u2019s actions on CNS are as follows.\nBased on location and activity, Vayu is divided into five.\u00a0\nIt includes Prana Vayu: It is located in the Murdha and traverses along Uras and Kantha. It maintains the proper functioning of buddhi (intellect), hrudaya (brain), indriya (sense organs), and chitta (mind).\u00a0\nIt performs functions like spitting, sneezing, belching, respiration, and deglutition.\u00a0\nIt can be interpreted as the functions of cranial nerves Olfactory, Optic, Trigeminal(ascending limb of sneezing reflex), Facial (motor, sensory, and moto-sensory components), Glossopharyngeal (swallowing and chemoreceptor components), Vagus (respiratory assistance and belching), respiratory centers of pons and medulla, pneumatic and apneustic centers, Wernicke\u2019s area(intelligence), other sensory and motor areas in the cerebral cortex.\nUdana Vayu:\n\u00a0Seat of udana vata is Uras. From the uras, it traverses from the nasa (nasal passage) to the nabhi (umbilical region) through the gala (throat).\u00a0\nIts functions include speech, enthusiasm, energy, memory, complexion, and strength. It can be interpreted as the functions of higher motor areas like Broca\u2019s area of speech.\u00a0\nThis involves functions involved in \u2013 Valsalvamaneuverie straining against forced expiration with closed glottis.\u00a0\nIt is one of the most necessary steps for initiating speech and for which enthusiasm and energy strength are required.\u00a0\nThe areas of memory, like the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes of the brain, along with several cortical areas, like the frontal lobes of the cerebrum, will also come under its functions.\nVyana Vayu:\n\u00a0\nIt is located in hrudaya and traverses along the whole body with very high velocity.\n\u00a0All motor functions of the body, such as rapid movements, movement, flexion, extension, closure of eyelids, and opening of eyelids, are under its control.\u00a0\nPhysiological aspects can be summarised as the motor system activities, including activities of reticular activating and inhibitory systems.\u00a0\nIt needs to be interpreted as sleep and arousal, the activity of RAS, functions of the locomotor system, and the areas for its control.\u00a0\nIn this context, hrudaya needs to be interpreted as the pre-central gyrus \u2013 the primary motor area of the cerebral cortex.\u00a0\nSuppose hrudaya is to be considered anatomically as the heart. In that case, it can be interpreted as the extrinsic sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations of the autonomic nervous system on the signaling system of the heart.\u00a0\nThe medullary area, which holds the vasomotor place, controls the autonomic reflexes of the heart and circulation by controlling the SA node.\u00a0\nThe limbic system is also involved in cardiac activity.\u00a0\nHormones like adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, and atrial natriuretic peptide(ANP) also possess a neural pathway projecting from the anteromedial part of the hypothalamus to the lower brain stem, which is concerned with the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system.\nSamana Vayu:\n\u00a0\nIt facilitates receiving food and digesting it.\u00a0\nIt separates the essence from excrement and liberates them to their respective pathways.\u00a0\nAll the neuro-hormonal influences of digestion, including the parasympathetic nervous system and enteric nervous system, are included under the concept of Samana vata.\u00a0\nThe enteric nervous system, which is comprised of Auerbach\u2019s plexus (myentric plexus) and Meisner\u2019s plexus(sub-mucous plexus) is called as enteric nervous system.\u00a0\nThey have sensory and motor functions and can be considered as the indigenous nervous system of GIT.\u00a0\nIt is extrinsically connected to the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers of the autonomic nervous system.\u00a0\nAuerbach\u2019s plexus controls gut motility (motor functions), and Meissner\u2019s plexus innervates glandular epithelium, intestinal endocrine cells, and blood vessels.\u00a0\nJust like the SA node of the heart, there are GI-pace maker cells in gut interstitial cells that govern the gut motility through basic electrical rhythm and migrating motor complex.\u00a0\nIt controls the rate of gastric secretion, bile flow, pancreatic secretion, and emptying of the stomach and small intestine.\nApana Vayu:\nIt mainly controls the sphincters of the orifices located in the anterior and posterior perineal triangles.\u00a0\nThis also aids the Valsalvamaneuver together with Udana Vayu.\u00a0\nIt mainly possesses three parts: an ascending limb to conduct impulses, a processing zone that determines the action to be taken, and a descending limb for executing appropriate motor activity. It majorly controls involuntary functions.\u00a0\nThe processing zones include spinal cord segments T-12 to L-2 and sacral regions for semen ejaculation and arcuate nuclei.\nApart from the vata dosha, pitta and kapha dosha also possess significant roles in CNS activities. Sadhaka pitta, Alochaka pitta, Bodhaka kapha, and Trapaka kapha also play an essential role in maintaining CNS activities. Alochaka pitta in the eye and bodhaka kapha in the tongue are also attributed to the sensory function.\u00a0\nSadhaka pitta:\n\u00a0\nIt is located in the hrudaya. It performs the functions of achieving intended objects with buddhi (intellect or ability for judgment), medha (discriminative ability), and abhimana (self-esteem).\u00a0\nThe functions attributed to sadhaka pitta can be correlated with cerebral cortical areas like Wernicke\u2019s center, thalamus, and hypothalamus.\n\u00a0It forms the seat of conscious and subconscious activities.\u00a0\nThe component of emotion can be also included under its function.\u00a0\nThe ring of cortical tissue around the hilum of the cerebral hemisphere and associated structures, like the amygdala, hippocampus, and septal nuclei, are known as the physiological lobe called the limbic system.\u00a0\nIt is the oldest phylogenetic part of the brain and controls emotions.\u00a0\nIt is concerned with primordial instincts like sexual behavior and emotions like fear, anger, rage, and motivation.\u00a0\nThe cortical tissue is the highly developed part of the brain concerned with higher intelligence, learning, and advanced comprehension ability.\nTarpaka kapha:\n\u00a0\nIt is situated in the head and responsible for the nourishment and proper functioning of sense organs.\u00a0\nIt can be correlated with cerebrospinal fluid.\u00a0\nIt is secreted from the choroid plexus and circulates through the ventricles of the brain, cisterns and subarachnoid space, and the central canal of the spinal cord.\u00a0\nFinally, it is absorbed by the arachnoid villi. It forms an essential barrier between blood and the brain and prevents the entry of macromolecules into the brain.\nThe functions of CNS from an Ayurvedic perspective can be explained as follows:\nSensory impulses from all sense organs are regulated or modified by prana vayu during their projection towards manas; thus it is indirectly associated with the functions of buddhi.\nPsychological functions are majorly controlled by udana vayu combined with prana vayu\nThe involuntary phase of respiration is controlled by prana vayu, whereas the voluntary phase is under the control of udana vayu\nMost vital vegetative functions are under the control of prana vayu and udana vayu.\u00a0\nThe circulatory system possesses the dual control of prana vayu and udana vayu.\nVerbal expression is maintained by udana vayuFunctions of the digestive and excretory system are mediated by samana vayu and apana vayu.\nThe parasympathetic division of the Autonomic nervous system can be attributed to the control of prana-udana-apana vayu.\nSympathetic division of the Autonomic nervous system can be majorly attributed to samana vayu. Hence it is clear that the CNS function involves tridoshas predominated with vata dosha.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n \nCauses of neurological disorders\n \nNeurological disorders can have many possible causes, including:\nGenetics:\n\u00a0\nSome neurological conditions are inherited or linked to genetic mutations.\u00a0\nIf there is a family history of a disorder like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, or Huntington\u2019s disease, you may be at higher risk.\n\u00a0Genetic testing can help determine if you carry specific gene mutations.\nInfections:\n\u00a0\nInfections such as meningitis, encephalitis, and neurosyphilis can damage the brain and nervous system.\u00a0\nViruses like herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, and West Nile virus have also been linked to neurological problems.\u00a0\nTimely vaccinations and preventing infections can help reduce risk.\nHead injuries:\n\u00a0\nNeurological disorders are caused majorly by traumatic brain injuries such as accidents, falls, or physical impacts that can contribute to long-term neurological issues like hemorrhagic stroke, paraplegia, convulsions, psychological disturbances, dementia, seizures, dizziness, or changes in behavior and mood. Wear protective headgear for high-risk activities like cycling, football or skateboarding.\nToxins:\n\u00a0\nExposure to harmful chemicals like toluene, methane gas, metals like lead or mercury, drugs or medications like narcotic drugs, long-term use of sleeping pills, etc, can potentially cause neurological damage or disorders over time.\u00a0\nLimiting exposure to these toxins, as well as being cautious with any medication use, may help decrease the likelihood of brain disorders.\nAging:\n\u00a0\nAs we get older, the risk for degenerative conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, and other age-related neurological disorders increases.\n\u00a0As aging is inevitable, a healthy lifestyle with a good diet, exercise, leisure activities, and mental stimulation may help prevent brain and nervous system disorders.\nOveractive Immune System:\n\u00a0\nThe human body produces antibodies to fight against infections and destroy foreign cells.\u00a0\nSometimes, these antibodies attack cells and affect various organ systems in the body, giving rise to an array of autoimmune diseases. When the immune system attacks the nervous system, it may cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, Multiple sclerosis, etc.\nUncontrolled Diabetes, Blood Pressure Levels, and Cholesterol levels:\u00a0\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension), cholesterol levels, and diabetes are both aspects of metabolic syndrome and often occur together.\u00a0\nPossible reasons for this may be that they have similar risk factors or that high blood sugar levels damage cells in the vascular system.\u00a0\nAs a result, the blood vessels supplying the brain get damaged and may even rupture, causing hemorrhagic stroke, aneurysm, etc.\nMoreover, uncontrolled diabetes can damage nerves, resulting in Diabetic polyneuropathy.\nFollowing an Ayurvedic lifestyle with natural treatments may help prevent or manage some neurological disorders.\u00a0\nHowever, for many conditions, medical care and prescription drugs are also often necessary, especially in severe or progressive cases.\u00a0\nAn integrative approach combining conventional and alternative medicine may offer the best results.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nSymptoms of neurological disorders\n \nNeurological disorders can manifest themselves through various symptoms that indicate your nervous system isn\u2019t functioning properly. Let\u2019s have a look into these common signs:\u00a0\nSudden unexplained Headache or Vomiting sensation\nThis might be alarming as it may be due to increased intracranial pressure.\u00a0\nIf you feel these, don\u2019t hesitate to approach a healthcare consultant immediately.\nLoss of sensation\n\u00a0If you start losing the ability to feel sensations like heat, cold, pain, touch, or pressure, it could signal a neurological problem.\u00a0\nNumbness, tingling, or a \u201cpins and needles\u201d feeling in your extremities are warnings that you should consult your doctor.\nMuscle weakness\u00a0\nOur nervous system controls our muscles, so if you notice a loss of strength in your muscles, it may point to an underlying neurological condition.\u00a0\nDifficulty walking, climbing stairs, lifting objects, or changes in handwriting can all be signs of muscle weakness.\u00a0\nImpaired vision\nDouble vision, blurred vision, pain in the eyes, pupils of unequal size, and drooping eyelids are all potential vision issues that could stem from a neurological disorder.\u00a0\nSee an eye doctor right away if you experience these symptoms.\nDifficulty swallowing\nTrouble chewing, swallowing, or choking on food and drink can signify a problem with your nervous system.\u00a0\nKnown as dysphagia, difficulty swallowing requires prompt medical treatment.\nDisturbed Coordination\nIf you feel like there is a disruption in your body\u2019s balance, sudden dizziness or inability to coordinate your daily chores might be a neurological issue.\u00a0\nConditions like ataxia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, or cerebellar disorders can be due to coordination difficulties.\nMuscle Rigidity\nCertain disorders like Parkinsonism can cause muscle rigidity as the first symptom, which can affect your mobility.\u00a0\nIf identified initially, you may be able to recover soon.\nTremors and Seizures\nTremors are involuntary shaking or trembling movements, and seizures can be predominantly\u00a0\ndue to underlying neurological conditions, including essential tremors, epilepsy, or Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nPain Radiating to Other Body Parts\nRadiating pain is probably a characteristic of nerve damage or compression. Conditions like herniated cervical or lumbar discs or spinal stenosis can cause such symptoms.\nSlurred Speech\nDifficulties in speech production, such as slurred or slow speech, can indicate neurological disorders affecting the temporal and parietal lobes of the brain.\u00a0\nSpeech problems are commonly seen in conditions like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nChanges in mood or behavior\nUnexplained changes in mood, personality, behavior, or mental abilities could indicate neurological dysfunction.\u00a0\nConditions like dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease are linked to these types of changes, so consult your doctor if you notice worrying differences in yourself or a loved one.\u00a0\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions are critical to managing symptoms and improving quality of life.\u00a0\nPay close attention to your body, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek medical advice if needed.\u00a0\nAn Ayurvedic practitioner can also provide natural therapies to help support nervous system health and function.\n \nAyurvedic concept on neurological disorders\n \nThe consequences of neurological diseases go beyond the physical signs. Individuals suffering from these illnesses frequently face emotional and psychological difficulties.\u00a0\nSeizures and chronic pain can be unexpected, resulting in worry, sadness, and social isolation.\u00a0\nIn certain circumstances, the side effects of traditional therapy might aggravate these emotional difficulties.\u00a0\nAs a result, more people are turning to alternative treatments like Ayurveda for effective and comprehensive remedies.\nAccording to Ayurveda, the Shiras or head is considered one among the Trimarmas(The three vital points in the body); inside it lies the brain, which is considered the seat of consciousness or awareness and intellect, and is connected to the rest of the body just as root forms an important part of the tree. Vitiation of Tridoshas, especially Vata dosha, can have an immense impact on the whole body, leading to a variety of illnesses.\n \nAyurvedic treatment for neurological disorders in Kerala\n \nAyurveda offers some promising treatments for neurological disorders, including both internal and external therapies in the form of sadhana and shamana chikitsa.\u00a0\nInternal medications\nInternal medications help control the tridoshas after shodhana chikitsa or in combination with it.\n\u00a0\nSeveral formulations are available in Ayurveda that possess neuroprotective effects, simultaneously managing the symptoms.\u00a0\nBacopa monnieri, commonly known as Brahmi, is an essential herb in managing nervous disorders because of its neuroprotective properties.\nTurmeric, or curcumin, is a potent anti-inflammatory that may help reduce inflammation in the brain.\u00a0\nIt helps reduce inflammation in the brain cells, rejuvenates it, and prevents brain damage.\nAshwagandha is another essential part of the medications that help rejuvenate brain cells and reduce anxiety and stress, which can exacerbate neurological symptoms.\u00a0\nThese herbs are usually consumed in combination under the supervision of an experienced Ayurvedic practitioner.\nAlso, there are formulations containing gold that help combat neurological disorders, which possess an immense impact in healing these disorders.\nRasayana medicines like Amalaki Rasayana, Chyavanaprasha, Brahmi Rasayana, etc., can also rejuvenate the brain cells and prevent degenerative disorders.\nShodhana Chikitsa\nShodhana therapies like Shirodhara, SHirovasti, Takradhara, Basti, Virechana, and Nasya are beneficial in removing the vitiated doshas from the body. These treatments are tailored to each individual based on their dosha or mind-body type. It helps reduce inflammation, relieve pressure on nerves and brain cells, and promote healing.\nYoga and meditation\nAsanas, pranayama, and meditation are also used to help balance the nervous system, release pent-up emotions, and find inner calm.\nSpecific yoga asanas (postures) such as Parvatasana, merudandasana, Talasana etc are proven beneficial.\nIt can help stimulate nerve endings and increase flexibility.\u00a0\nAnuloma Viloma, Nadi Shuddhi, and Bhramari pranayama, as well as meditation and Yama and Niyama of Ashtanga yoga, turn off the unwanted thoughts in your mind and cultivate awareness and inner peace. Over time, these practices may help rewire your brain\n \nPanchakarma Therapies For Neurological Diseases\n \nAyurvedic treatments involve the use of Ayurvedic medicine and Panchakarma therapies i.e. Snehana (Oleation therapy), Swedana (fomentation), Virechana (Purgation), Vasti (Enema), Vamana (Emesis), Shirodhara, Shirovasti, Murdha Taila (head massage) and use of Nadi Swedana (herbal steam), etc.\nPanchakarma is a live-fold detoxification treatment in Ayurveda that helps remove toxins from the body and balance the doshas. It\u2019s an effective method for managing neurological disorders. The five actions of Panchakarma aim to remove excess doshas and waste products from the body. They include:\nSnehana:\n\u00a0\nMassaging the body with medicated oils such as Ashvagandha taila, Mahanarayana taila, Kshirabala taila, Sahacharadi taila, Mahamasha taila, Bala taila, and Dhanvantara Taila re beneficial in neurological diseases.\nSwedana:\u00a0\nKsheera dhara, 7 days of Patrapinda sveda or Sarvanga sveda (Steam treatment), Shashtika shali pinda sweda, or Mamsa pinda sweda etc are proven to be beneficial\u00a0\nVirechana:\n\u00a0\nPurgation therapy to remove excess pitta dosha from the intestines. Cleanses the gut and blood, benefitting the nervous system.\nBasti:\n\u00a0\nEnema therapy to flush excess vata dosha from the colon. Nourishes the colon and tissues, calming the nervous system\nNasya:\u00a0\nInstilling medicated oils such as Narayana taila, and Ksheerabala taila for seven days\nShirovasti\n\u00a0\nwith Ksheerabala taila, masha taila etc. It clears blocked energy channels in the head and neck region, relieving neurological pressure.\nMatra Vasti\n\u00a0\ndaily with 50 ml of dhanvantara taila, Saindhava lavana (Q.S.), and Shatapushpa for 15-21 days\nRajayapana vasti\nTakradhara\nShirodhara or Shiro Pichu\n\u00a0\nwith medicated liquids such as Mahakukkutamamsa taila, Ksheerabala tail, Maasha taila, Maha narayana taila, etc., daily.\nPanchakarma should only be administered under the guidance of a trained Ayurvedic physician.\u00a0\nWhen performed correctly, Panchakarma can help remove deep-rooted toxins, relieve neurological pressure; nourish the nervous system, and restore balance to restore health.\u00a0\nThe detoxification and rejuvenation it provides can help manage and even heal many neurological conditions.\u00a0\nPanchakarma, along with appropriate diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies, offers a holistic solution for overcoming neurological disorders in an all-natural way.\n \nDiet For Neurological Diseases\n \nAyurvedic approaches to neurological health emphasize the importance of diet in maintaining overall well-being.\nAccording to Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution that necessitates a personalized diet, but general dietary guidelines can assist most people in maintaining their neurological health.\u00a0\nAyurveda emphasizes eating nourishing, whole foods that are easy to digest, with omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods like walnuts, flaxseeds, and fatty fish beneficial for brain health.\u00a0\nAnti-inflammatory and antioxidant herbs and spices such as turmeric, ginger, and cumin are also recommended as alternatives to processed foods, refined sugars, and caffeine, which can disrupt dosha balance and harm neurological health.\nThe brain is essential in daily tasks, and diet has a significant impact on how it functions.\u00a0\nFor thousands of years, diet and exercise be important factors in shaping the evolution of the brain and its cognitive capacity.\u00a0\nDiets rich in Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to improve cognitive function of the brain, whereas diets high in saturated fats have been shown to worsen cognitive processing.\nSerotonin, a neurotransmitter, is important in regulating sleep, appetite, and pain sensations and is secreted by the gastrointestinal tract, which, along with neurons, contributes to our emotions.\u00a0\nA diet that helps improve serotonin levels helps manage anxiety, stress, and mental balance.\u00a0\nSeveral studies have proved the importance of one such diet plan, the Mediterranean diet, which helps enhance serotonin production and reduce the risk of depression by 25%-35% compared to other diets.\nA brain-healthy diet should include the following food groups: complex carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Complex carbohydrates provide energy to the body, whereas essential fatty acids account for the majority of fat in the brain.\u00a0\nAvoiding trans fats and hydrogenated fats can help prevent essential fatty acid function.\u00a0\nDeficits in vitamins and minerals can cause memory problems, fatigue, weak muscles, mouth ulcers, and psychological issues.\nThe Mediterranean diet\nThe Mediterranean diet, which originated in the 1960s, is a popular brain health diet that has been shown in countries such as Greece and Italy to reduce stroke and heart attack rates.\u00a0\nThis Mediterranean cuisine contains fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and olive oil.\nDaily consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, weekly consumption of poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt; moderate consumption of dairy products; limited consumption of red meat; and avoidance of sweetened beverages, processed foods, and refined oils are the essential components of a Mediterranean diet.\nVegetables\u00a0\nInclude tomatoes, broccoli, spinach, onions, carrots, Brussels sprouts, cucumber, and kale.\nFruits\n\u00a0\nFruits such as apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, oranges, dates, and melons\nNuts and seeds\n\u00a0\nNuts such as almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds\nLegumes\u00a0\nLegumes such as beans, lentils, peas, pulses, and chickpeas, tubers such as sweet potato\nWhole grains\nWhole grains such as brown rice, barley, corn\nFish and seafood\nSeafoods such as sardines, tuna, trout, mackerel, oysters, prawns, crabs and mussels\nPoultry\n\u00a0\nPoultry such as chicken and duck, eggs such as duck, quail, and chicken eggs\nDairy products\n\u00a0\nDairy products such as yogurt\nHerbs and spices\nHerbs and spices\u00a0 such as garlic, basil, mint, sage, rosemary, mint, nutmeg, and cinnamon\nHealthy fats\n\u00a0\nHealthy fats such as olive oil, coconut oil, etc.\nAnother ideal brain health diet is the Mind Diet, a combination of a Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). It is designed to prevent reduced brain functioning and dementia.\u00a0\nThe Mediterranean diet, a combination of the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), is beneficial for brain health because it lowers blood pressure and reduces the risk of heart disease. The MIND diet suggests eating ten healthy foods and avoiding five unhealthy foods.\nHealthy foods\nGreen leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, and salads; non-starchy vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, broccoli, and onion; beans such as soybeans, lentils, and beans; berries such as strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries twice a week; nuts such as hazelnuts, walnuts, cashew nuts, olive oil as the primary cooking oil, whole grains such as Quinoa, oatmeal, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, bread\nUnhealthy foods\nInclude cheese, red meat, butter, fast food, and desserts.\nNutraceuticals\nNutraceuticals are nonspecific biological therapies that play an essential role in neuroprotection.\nFruits, vegetables, grains, meat, fish, eggs, and dairy are examples of food-based or traditional nutraceuticals, such as vitamin B12, that provide benefits beyond essential nutrition.\u00a0\nMinerals, fatty acids, vitamins, and amino acids are nutrients with well-established nutritional properties in metabolic pathways.\u00a0\nThey can be combined with animal and plant products to treat neurological disorders. Fatty acids and their derivatives improve brain function and aid in the reduction of cholesterol in the arteries, resulting in hypolipidemic effects.\nThe Mediterranean diet and DASH intervention are critical for brain health and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.\u00a0\nIndividuals can improve their cognitive performance, prevent neurodegenerative diseases, and reduce stress and anxiety by following these guidelines.\n\u00a0\n \nLifestyle Recommendations for neurological Disorders\n \nEat in moderation.\nA well-balanced, nutrient-dense diet is critical for Alzheimer\u2019s disease prevention. Meals containing antioxidants, Omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins can help protect brain cells from damage and inflammation.\nBerries, fatty fish, leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains should be staples in everyone\u2019s diet, and limiting saturated fat and refined sugar consumption is critical for brain health.\nAvoid highly spicy foods, salty foods, high-calorie foods like tapioca, oily foods, spicy-oil-salty pickles, etc.\nAvoid snacking intermittently and limit eating to three times a day.\nStop eating late at night and have a light dinner at 8 p.m.\nReduce the intake of rice or carbs by increasing the amount of vegetables and fruits.\nPure cow\u2019s ghee, buttermilk with ginger or turmeric, and black pepper can be taken along with lunch.\nEggs, meat foods, etc. can be used according to the stage of the disease and with the advice of an Ayurvedic expert.\nLimit the intake of protein, manganese, and Vitamin B\nMake it a habit to take afternoon naps on a recliner, practice leisure activities, and take small walks.\nTake a good night\u2019s sleep as a fruitful event to good health.\nSleep well for six hours.\nFollow a proper dinacharya\nTurn your mind away from stress and anxiety.\nBelieve that you will overcome this time and make your body stronger.\nThis disease can be effectively controlled by adding diet, lifestyle, and stress management training.\nGood support from family members is also necessary.\nLimit your alcohol consumption and avoid smoking.\nPeople can protect their cognitive health by keeping physically active, eating a nutritious diet, engaging in mental activities, receiving enough quality and quantity of sleep, fostering social connections, managing stress, and avoiding hazardous behaviors.\nIt\u2019s always possible to start making these lifestyle changes to invest in a healthy brain.\u00a0\nIndividuals can significantly reduce their risk of cognitive decline by limiting their alcohol consumption and avoiding smoking.\n \nHerbs used in Ayurvedic Treatment of Neurological Disorders?\n \nAshwagandha\nAshwagandha is a combination of amino acids and vitamins that acts as an adaptogen.\u00a0\nIt helps the body adapt to stressful situations and increases energy and stamina.\u00a0\nAshwagandha removes the problem of insomnia and also plays a vital role in balancing energy.\nIt is an adaptogenic herb that helps reduce stress and anxiety, which can exacerbate neurological symptoms.\u00a0\nIt contains compounds that may help regenerate neuronal connections and protect nerve cells from damage.\u00a0\nAshwagandha can be made into powder form and consumed with warm milk before bed to improve sleep and relaxation.\nBrahmi\nBrahmi is a very miraculous herb that plays an important role in reducing mental stress.\u00a0\nIt helps in reducing the cortisol hormone, which is the main cause of stress.\u00a0\nIt contains active compounds that help protect nerve cells from damage and boost the growth of new neural connections.\u00a0\nBrahmi powder can be taken as such or mixed with ghee.\nTurmeric or Curcumin\nTurmeric is rich in curcumin, a compound with neuroprotective effects.\u00a0\nIt helps reduce inflammation in the brain, stimulating the growth of new cell connections and protecting nerve cells from further damage.\u00a0\nYou can take supplements containing curcumin and piperine or consume turmeric with ghee and black pepper.\nEssential Oil\nEssential oils like frankincense, lavender, peppermint, and rosemary have therapeutic properties that can help relieve neurological symptoms when inhaled or applied to the skin.\u00a0\nPlace a few drops of essential oil into a diffuser to disperse the aroma in your home.\u00a0\nYou can also dilute essential oils with a carrier oil like coconut oil and massage into your temples. Neck and feet.\u00a0\nGuduchi\nGuduchi is an adaptogenic and nourishing herb with sattvic qualities that help strengthen the nervous system, protect it from stress, and calm the mind. Loaded with antioxidants, it delays cell damage and improves strength.\nJatamansi\nIt is a beneficial herb to relieve stress and fatigue.\u00a0\nThe roots of spikenard are used as medicine. It acts as a medicine for the stressed brain.\u00a0\nJatamasi relieves the body and mind by removing toxins from the brain and body.\nVacha\nVacha is a magical herb that plays a vital role in curing various serious mental illnesses.\u00a0\nThis herb is known to produce dopamine (happy hormone) in the brain naturally. Doctors often prescribe Vacha to patients for insomnia and to calm the nerves.\n \nFAQ\n \nWhich is the best Ayurveda neuro treatment in Kerala?\nKeraleeya panchakarma therapies offer promising benefits for neurological disorders, which include Takradhara, Tailadhara, Shirovasti, Shiro pichu, Abhyanga, Elakizhi, Njavara kizhi, Mamsa kizhi, Nasya etc. \nAll these procedures should be done strictly under the direction of an Ayurvedic physician.\n \nHow does Ayurveda work in treating common neurological disorders?\nyurvedic medications for neurological problems address the disease at its root. \nThe primary focus of the treatment for common neurological disorders is removing toxins or doshas from the body and restoring it to equilibrium through Panchakarma therapy. \nPanchakarma is a system of medicine that uses herbalized oils, body treatments such as oil massage, steam therapy, herbal paste therapy, nasal therapy, vomiting therapies, enema therapy, and purgation therapies to help the body clear itself of toxins and impurities accumulated in it.\n \nWhich is the best nerve tonic in Ayurveda?\nAyurveda offers a particular group of medicines regarded as the medhya rasayana as nerve tonics. \nIt helps to improve memory and intellect through specific actions. \nIn addition to intellect, it helps improve nutrition, health, memory, intelligence, immunity, and thus longevity when consumed regularly. \nIt includes Mandukaparni (Centella Asiatica), Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), and Shankhapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis). \nMedhya Rasayana can be used alone or in combination with other herbs.\nYou can take it as a combination or directed by an Ayurvedic doctor.\n \nCan neurological conditions be cured?\nIt depends on the nature of your disease, your age, sex, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. \nAyurvedic treatment focuses on bringing the body back into balance and promoting healing. \nThough it can provide significant relief from symptoms and improve overall well-being, a full recovery depends on several factors, including the severity of the disorder, individual response to treatment, and adherence to lifestyle changes.\n \nCan Ayurveda cure nerve problems?\nAyurveda can cure most of the neurological problems where Western Treatment options fail. \nNumerous case studies and success stories show that Ayurvedic treatment for neurological disorders is effective. \nThese stories show how Ayurveda can have a positive impact on people's lives.

Diet and lifestyle modification is also the part of this treatment.\nAyurveda can provide a better cure and save you from complicated surgeries with our specialized panchakarma therapies.\nOsteoarthritis is the most common\n arthritis\n caused by the degeneration of cartilage.\nAyurvedic nutritional treatments can easily tackle these degenerative changes.\nWhat is Osteoarthritis\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder caused mainly by the wear and tear of the joints. Knees, cervical, lumbar, hips, shoulders, and distal interphalangeal joints are affected most frequently. It mainly affects older people; among them, women are more prone to this disease than men. This usually follows post-menopause due to the osteoporotic changes in the bones.\nOsteoarthritis mainly affects the cartilage.\u00a0\nHealthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another. It acts as a shock absorber during physical movements.\n\u00a0In Osteoarthritis, the surface layer of cartilage breaks and wears away. This allows bones under the cartilage to rub each other, causing pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion in the joint.\u00a0\nCauses\nHereditary factors\nOveruse of a particular joint\nAgeing\nChange in chemical characteristics of the ground substance in the joint\nObesity\nOrthopaedic deformities\nPre-existing joint disease\nEndocrine disorders like diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism\nSensory neuropathies\nEarly Symptoms\nJoint pain after walking or due to overuse\nCrackling or grating sensation in the joints\nSwelling\nTenderness\nReduced range of movements in the joints\nLater Symptoms\nVague pain and stiffness in the joints, especially after getting up from the sitting posture in the later stages.\nDisability while walking down the stairs.\nOsteophyte formation at the distal interphalangeal joints.\nSwelling in the joints.\nRestricted and painful movements of the joint.\nThe increased local temperature at the affected site.\nDifferent stages of Osteoarthritis\nThe four stages of Osteoarthritis are:\nStage 1: Minor\nMinor wear-and-tear in the joints. Little or no pain in the affected area.\nStage 2: Mild\nBony overgrowth (spurs) appears.\u00a0\nThe affected area feels stiff after a long sedentary period.\u00a0\nStage 3: Moderate\nCartilage in the affected joints begins to degenerate, and the joint becomes inflamed, which causes discomfort in performing daily activities.\u00a0\nStage 4: Severe\nThe patient experience severe excruciating pain\nThe cartilage is almost wholly damaged, leading to an inflammatory response from the joint.\nThe presence of bony spurs (osteophytes) may cause severe pain.\nAyurvedic Treatment for Osteoarthritis\nAccording to Ayurveda, Osteoarthritis occurs due to vitiated Vata dosha leading to asthi dhatu kshaya (decreased bone density).\u00a0\nAyurvedic Treatment\n for Osteoarthritis in Kerala is very effective to manage the pain and the associated problems.\nThis can be managed by \u201cbrahmana\u201d and \u201cbalya\u201d chikitsa (nourishing therapies).\u00a0\nAdministration of medicated milk and ghee has particular importance here.\nPanchakarma Treatments for Osteoarthritis\nPanchakarma treatment\n for Osteoarthritis is mainly done before the nourishing therapies for Osteoarthritis.\nAdministration of medicated ghee and oil is done before Virechana (Purgation). Generally, Snigdha Virechana (Purgation using oil or ghee) is preferred here to prevent further Vata vitiation.\u00a0\nVasti is also very much beneficial in Osteoarthritis to prevent further degeneration.\nExternal therapies such as Lepanam, Parisheka, Abhyanga, Local vasthi (Oil pooling), Njavarakizhi (Medicated rice massage), and Ksheera Basti (Medicated milk enema) are used to strengthen the cartilages and joints.\nOther procedures like Podikkizhi ( Herbal powder massage), Illakkizhi (Herbal leaves massage), Dhanyamladhara (Pouring of a fermented liquid), and Kashaya vasthi (Enema With herbal decoctions) are also very beneficial in reducing inflammation.\nAbhyanga:\nMedicated oils are used for the massage of affected joints, which reduces pain and stiffness in the joint and balances the Vata dosha.\nPatra Potala Sweda or Herbal pouch massage\u00a0\nPatra Potli Sweda is a hot herbal pouch massage where different medicinal leaves are used to prepare the pouch, dipped in hot oil.\nThe heat from the pouch provides immediate relief and also detoxifies the body. The treatment has a rejuvenating effect which helps improve the range of motion of the joints and relieves acute pain and stiffness.\nShashtika shali pinda sweda or Njavara kizhi\nNjavarakizhi is a hot pouch massage where njavara rice, milk, and Bala moola kwath(decoction) are used for its preparation. Pouches filled with medicated rice dipped in oil are applied during the massage. This massage helps repair and rejuvenate the degenerated joints, thereby relieving the pain and stiffness.\nLocalized Vasti\nSpecially prepared medicated oil is kept over the affected joint with a herbal paste boundary. It helps in nourishing and lubricating the joints and increases the flexibility of the joints.\nBasti (cleansing enema)\nHere medicines are given through the anal canal. As the Pakvasaya (large intestine) is considered the abode of Vata dosha, Vasti is the primary treatment of choice for most of the neurological and musculoskeletal disorders caused by aggravated Vata.\u00a0\nHerbal decoctions and milk are used for Vasti in this disease.\nJaloukavacharana or Leech therapy\nJaloukavacharana\n\u00a0is a treatment modality wherein leeches are made to bite over the affected area.\u00a0\nIt is a proven technique to reduce pain and swelling in Osteoarthritis.\nBesides these treatment modalities, weight reduction is necessary to make the joints stress-free.\n\u00a0It also suggests Yoga asanas, Pranayama, and other relaxation techniques for the treatment of Osteoarthritis.\n\u00a0Internal medications, including Calcium supplements, are another part of this treatment that is necessary to get an ultimate cure for this disease.

It provides lubrication to the joints and reduces the chances of Osteoarthritis.\nDos and Don\u2019ts during treatment\nDo\u2019s:\n\u00a0\nIntake of Madhura (sweet), Amla (sour), Lavana (salt), and Snigdha (unctuous) food, Garlic, Ginger, Hing, Black pepper, etc\nRegular Exercise is mandatory\nMaintaining optimum weight;\nAvoiding excessive repetitive motions\nHealthy diet and lifestyle\nProtecting an injured joint from further damage\nDon\u2019ts:\n\u00a0\nLong fasting and excess of heavy food\u00a0\nAwakening at night (Ratri Jagran),\u00a0\nVega Dharana (suppression of natural urges),\u00a0\nStress,\nProlonged standing,\u00a0\nOverexertion and injury to joints\nHow to avoid the recurrence of Osteo arthritis?\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle with low-impact exercise, getting plenty of rest and enough sleep, and a healthy diet and weight are simple ways to prevent its recurrence.

Don\u2019t worry Ayurvedic Treatment for Sciatica in Kerala is very effective to treat your pain and related problems.\n \nOnline Consultation\nAyurvedic Packages For Sciatica in Kerala\n \n \nMake An Enquiry\nSitting with Sciatica?? Ever thought of a permanent cure? You have heard it right! Ayurveda can give you relief from this debilitating disease.\n \nWhat is Sciatica\nSciatica is a neurological condition characterized by excruciating pain, tenderness and numbness along the course of the sciatic nerve, which runs along the posterior part of the leg.\nCauses Of Sciatica\nCompression of\u00a0\nthe Sciatic nerve leads to inflammation of the areas surrounding the Sciatic nerve leading to this medical condition.\nDietary Causes\nIntake of too much spicy, cold, dry food, Improper eating habits, and Eating incompatible foods and Diets irrespective of the seasonal regimen as per Ayurveda causes Sciatica.\nLifestyle Causes\nDamage to the Sciatic nerve is due to strenuous activity such as lifting weights or over-exposure to cold wind. Hereditary factors also pave the way for neurological disorders. Prolonged sitting or standing can pinch the nerve roots, causing pain. Excess weight gain can put pressure on the spinal disc causing disc compression.\nEndocrine disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, can damage the peripheral nerves, including the Sciatica nerve. The Sciatic nerve can also be affected if there is a pelvis or hip joint fracture.\nSymptoms of Sciatica\n Pain in the lower back, buttocks, legs and foot\n The pain progresses through the posterior part of the leg, which deteriorates while walking, sitting and standing.\n Pin and needle pricking sensation\n Stretching or pulling type of pain\n Numbness, pain and weakness in the leg and foot parts.\n Tingling sensation anywhere in the leg.\n Difficulty in controlling movements of legs\n Symptoms are more likely to manifest on one side of the body.\n In severe cases, burning sensation.\n Weakness and numbness in the lower limb.\n After standing in place or while walking, feeling heaviness in the leg and inability to move the leg.\n Shooting pain in the lower limb makes it difficult to stand up.\n Inability to stand straight.\n Constant pain sensations in the lower limb, even while sleeping.\nHow to diagnose Sciatica Pain?\nSciatica is generally diagnosed by physical examination and the history of the symptoms. . The most applied diagnostic test is the straight leg raise (SLR) which is considered positive if the pain is felt along the distribution of the sciatic nerve and is reproduced on raising the legs between 30 and 70 degrees. This test is positive in about 90% of people with Sciatica; fortunately or unfortunately, approximately 75% of people with a positive test do not have Sciatica. X-ray Lumbar spine helps assess the vertebra\u2019s position and its associated abnormalities. Imaging tests such as computerized tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) can help diagnose lumbar disc herniation.\nDiseases associated with Sciatica\u00a0\nSciatic leg pain is often associated with several conditions that pinch or irritate the sciatic nerve.\nPiriformis syndrome\nSpasms in the piriformis muscle can cause compression of the sciatic nerve.\nHerniated disc\nThe intervertebral disc may bulge or herniate and cause nerve compression.\nLumbar Spinal Stenosis\nNarrowing the spinal canal in the lower back may cause increased spinal cord and nerve pressure.\nDegenerative disc disease\nThe \nintervertebral disc\n may dry out and shrink as a part of the natural aging process. This causes nerve compression.\nSpondylolisthesis\nA condition in which one vertebrae slips forward over another, resulting in the nerves\u2019 compression.\nLeg pain can also be due to hip or sacroiliac joint diseases.

Ayurvedic Treatment for Sinusitis in Kerala is designed to treat the disease from the root level.\nAt \nSaatwika Ayurveda Treatment Centre\n we use both internal and external medicine to treat Sinusitis\nAyurvedic medicine\n has been clearing nasal passages and soothing sinus inflammation for centuries.\u00a0\nThese all-natural remedies get to the root cause of your misery and provide better relief.\u00a0\nIn just a few simple steps, you\u2019ll be breathing easy and wondering why you didn\u2019t try this sooner.\n \nConsult With Our Doctor\n \nChat Now\nWrite an EMail\nWhat is Sinusitis?\nSinusitis is i\nnflammation \nof the sinuses, the air-filled cavities around your nose.\u00a0\nWhen your sinuses get inflamed, it can feel like pressure, congestion, and pounding pain around your eyes, cheeks, and forehead.\nCauses and Symptoms\nSinusitis is a disease that is often caused by a viral infection, like the common cold. Bacteria, allergies, and irritants can also trigger sinus inflammation. Symptoms include:\nFacial pressure or pain\nThick nasal discharge\nCongestion and blockage\nCough\nHeadache\nSymptoms of sinusitis\nIf your nose is stuffed up and you\u2019ve got a throbbing headache, you may have sinusitis. Some common symptoms to watch out for:\nPressure and pain in your face, especially around your eyes, nose, and forehead.\nThick, discolored mucus drainage.\nNasal congestion that just won\u2019t quit.\nCoughing, especially at night.\nLoss of smell or taste.\nCauses of sinusitis\nSeveral factors can trigger or exacerbate sinus inflammation, leading to sinusitis.\nEnvironmental irritants\nExposure to pollutants like dust, mold, and pet dander may trigger an immune system response that causes sinusitis.\u00a0\nTry to minimize exposure to known irritants in your home and work environment.\u00a0\nAn air purifier having HEPA filter can help reduce airborne allergens.\nInfection\nBacterial, viral, or fungal infections in the sinuses often lead to sinusitis. The most common causes are viruses, like the common cold.\u00a0\nBacterial infections tend to linger longer and may require antibiotics to clear.\u00a0\nPractice good hygiene, like hand washing, to avoid spreading infections.\nAllergies\nAllergic reactions to airborne substances you inhale can cause sinusitis. Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\u00a0\nSee an allergy specialist for allergy testing and treatment, like antihistamines or allergy shots, to help reduce inflammation and open your nasal passages.\nAnatomical factors\nConditions like nasal polyps, a deviated septum, or a narrowed sinus opening can make you more prone to sinusitis.\u00a0\nThese obstructions prevent mucus drainage and ventilation of the sinuses.\u00a0\nCorrective surgeries may be options to open airways and provide lasting relief from chronic sinusitis.\nAyurvedic perspective on Sinusitis\nAccording to Ayurveda, sinusitis results mainly from kapha and vata dosha imbalance.\u00a0\nVata governs movement in the body, including the flow of mucus.\nKapha is responsible for mucus production.\u00a0\nAyurveda considers sinusitis under\u00a0\nkaphaja shirashoola\n\u00a0where the patient experiences dull pain throughout the day and exacerbations in the kapha kaala, i.e., mainly in the early morning and at night(Diurnal variations according to doshas).\nAccording to Ayurveda, sinusitis is mainly caused by excessive sleep, a sedentary lifestyle, fast foods, foods containing high amounts of fats, and excessive eating.\u00a0\nThese causative factors cause the accumulation of kapha dosha, which leads to blockage of sinuses, resulting in sinus inflammation.\nModern approach and Ayurvedic approach in sinusitis treatment\nThe modern approach to treating sinusitis typically involves antibiotics, steroids, and over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms like nasal decongestants.\u00a0\nWhile these may give temporary relief, they do not care the underlying causes of chronic sinus inflammation.\nAyurveda takes a holistic approach to sinus health by balancing the doshas \u2013 vata and kapha doshas.\u00a0\nAn imbalance in these bodily energies can lead to excess mucus buildup and inflammation in the sinuses.\u00a0\nAyurvedic treatments aim to clear nasal passages, reduce inflammation, and strengthen the immune system.\nAyurvedic treatment for sinusitis in Kerala\nAyurveda, an ancient Indian medicinal practice, offers natural remedies to relieve sinusitis symptoms. Two effective treatments are:\nTeekshna Nasya: Ayurvedic nasal drops containing herbs like nasya oil can help lubricate and open nasal passages. They are very effective in relieving nasal dryness and congestion.\nNeti pot: Using a neti pot with a saline solution is an excellent way to flush out nasal congestion and clear passages. The neti pot is just like a teapot, and you pour the solution through one nostril so it drains out the other side. This washes away mucus, allergens, and irritants. Create the saline solution with distilled water and non-iodized sea salt. Use one teaspoon of salt for every quart of lukewarm water. Tilt your head and pour the solution through your nasal passage. Breathe through your mouth as it drains. Gently blow your nose to clear any remaining solution. Neti pot use provides quick relief and can prevent future sinus issues when used regularly.\nGhrutapana, Tikshna basti, Daha Karma, Raktamokashana, Upanaha and Lepa\nVamana (emesis): It is also a very effective treatment modality as it will expel the vitiated kapha dosha from the body and help relieve headaches.\nGandusha, Acchapana, Swedana, Agnikarma etc., are also advised.\nRegimen during Ayurvedic Treatment for Sinusitis in Kerala\nTo help clear your nasal passages and relieve sinus pressure, try this ayurvedic regimen:\nNasal Irrigation\nUse a neti pot to flush out mucus and moisten nasal passages. Fill the pot with warm water and 1/2 teaspoon of non-iodized salt. Tilt your head to the side, place the spout in one nostril, and gently pour the water in until it flows out the other side. Breathe through your mouth as you do this. Repeat on the other side. Do this 1-2 times a day. The salt helps reduce inflammation, while the water hydrates your nasal tissues.\nSteam Inhalation\nInhaling steam may help ease congestion and help it eliminate. Bring a pot of water and boil. Remove from heat, then put in a handful of essential oils like peppermint or eucalyptus.\nPlace your face over the pot, drape a towel on the head to trap the steam, and breathe deeply for 10-15 minutes.\u00a0\nThe moist heat will help relieve pressure and open your nasal passages.\nEssential Oils\nApply essential oils with decongestant properties like eucalyptus, peppermint, or lavender around your nose or diffuse them in an oil diffuser. \nTheir aromatic compounds can help loosen mucus and make it easier to breathe.\u00a0\nAdd one or two drops oil like coconut oil and rub it onto your chest, neck, and behind your ears to relieve congestion.\nLukewarm Compresses\nApply a warm, wet washcloth to your face, especially over your nose, cheeks, and eyes.\u00a0\nThe heat will help relax your nasal tissues and increase blood flow to relieve pressure.\u00a0\nDo this for 10-15 minutes a few times a day to experience quick relief from congestion and make it easier to drain mucus.\nHow to prevent sinusitis with lifestyle\nTo help prevent sinusitis in the first place, make some lifestyle changes.\nPractice good hygiene\nWash your hands regularly and avoid close contact with people who are sick. \nGerms and viruses are common causes of sinus inflammation.\nUse a humidifier to moisten air in your home, especially in winter. Dry air can irritate your nasal passages. Aim for 30-50% humidity.\nQuit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking damages the cilia tiny hairs in your nose that help clear out mucus and pathogens.\nManage allergies\nAllergic reactions release histamine that can trigger sinusitis. See an allergist for allergy testing and potential treatments like:\nImmunotherapy, like allergy shots. These can help desensitize you to allergens over time.\nOral antihistamines and nasal sprays. These provide relief from symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion.\nAvoid known allergens when possible. Make your home a low-allergen zone and shower/change clothes after being outside.\nUse a saline nasal rinse to flush out allergens and keep nasal passages moist. This can relieve pressure and congestion.\nBy making a few lifestyle changes, you can avoid sinusitis altogether or at least reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. Preventing health issues is always easier than treating them, so take proactive steps for sinus health and breathing easy.\nDiet\nWhen it comes to diet, you can do a few key things to help relieve sinus pressure and open up your nasal passages.\nEat spicy foods\nAdd some heat to your diet by incorporating spicy foods like chili peppers, horseradish, and mustard.\u00a0\nSpicy foods contain compounds like capsaicin that can help thin out mucus secretions and make it easier to drain your sinuses.\nIncrease moisture\nStaying hydrated is key.\u00a0\nAim for enough glasses of water daily to moisten your nasal passages. Soups, stews and broths are also great options.\u00a0\nThe warmth and moisture will provide relief from congestion.\nLimit dairy, wheat, and sugar\n.\nDairy products, wheat, and sugary foods can increase mucus production. Cut back on milk, cheese, and sweets, which may worsen your symptoms. Wheat contains gluten, which may stimulate an allergic reaction in your body.\nAdd ginger and turmeric\n.\nGinger and turmeric have natural anti-inflammatory properties.\u00a0\nAdd fresh grated ginger to soups or smoothies, or make turmeric tea.\u00a0\nThe compounds in these spices can help reduce inflammation in the sinuses and provide quick relief from pressure.\nGarlic\nGarlic has antimicrobial properties and can help boost your immunity. Adding more raw garlic to your diet, especially when you first start to feel congested, may help nip a sinus infection in the bud.\u00a0\nMix minced garlic into soups, stews, salad dressings, or pasta sauce.\nHome remedies for sinusitis\nA simple home remedy using ayurvedic ingredients can help relieve sinus pressure and open up your nasal passages.\nNeti pot nasal irrigation\nA neti pot is used to flush nasal passages with a saline solution. Mix about one teaspoon of non-iodized salt with 2 cups of distilled water.\u00a0\nTilt your head to the side and pour the solution into one nostril so it flows out the other side. Breathe through your mouth as you do this.\u00a0\nThe salt helps reduce inflammation while the water washes away mucus and irritants. Use 1-2 times daily to keep nasal passages clear.\nBe sure to use purified water and a sterile neti pot to avoid infection.\u00a0\nThe use of a neti pot can help relieve sinusitis symptoms and make breathing easier.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMany people wonder if there are natural ways to cure sinusitis for good.

Consult with our doctor for a personalised package.\n \n \nConsult With Doctor\nAyurvedic Treatment for Stress in Kerala. \n \nSaatwika Offers pure Ayurvedic treatment for stress, in Kerala Centre. This destress package or stress management package is tailor-made.\nAfter a complete diagnosis our physician package the treatment plan.\n \nWhat is Stress?\n \n \n\u00a0The body has a natural effort to adjust to external or internal stimuli that tend to produce strain or disequilibrium of the body and mind. \nSuch physiological and psychological efforts of the body are termed stress.\n Stress is experienced for everyone at many points in day-to-day life.\n This is not only for humans but also for every living being in this World.\u00a0\n \nTypes of Stress \n \nThere are two kinds of stress. \nOne type is called \n\u2018eustress\u2019\n because the self creates it after engaging in activities like playing, working, sex, etc. \nThe second kind is the unusually prolonged and recurrent occurrence of stressful conditions, which can inevitably cause damage to the body as well as the mind.\n It is termed as \u2018distress\u2019. While eustress is considered healthy, distress is just the opposite of it. \nWe usually use the term \u2018stress\u2019 for this second type called \u2018distress\u2019. \nDistress can be of two types, mainly depending on onset and duration.\u00a0\n1. Acute distress.\n2. Chronic distress.\nAcute distress is sudden in origin like accidents, trauma, assault, illness, mental torture, valuables, loss of close ones etc. \nThis leads to a kind of mental state of grief and variable symptoms. \nThis may last for some days and may leave post-traumatic stress disorder complications. Anxiety and depression are the major symptoms, insomnia, headache, restlessness, lack of concentration etc.\nThe World faces the second type, which can be rightfully called a lifestyle disease, which is chronic distress (or simply \u2018Stress according to lay man\u2019s vocabulary). \nThis needs some serious insights.\u00a0\nBecause it affects the very meaning of a healthy and satisfying life, numerous factors contribute immensely to developing such stress.\nThe fast culture of life, change to white-collar jobs which demands many person-hours for a handful of salary, the family problems, financial issues, social environment, etc., can create stress.\nWhen proper rest is not given to the body and mind due to overloaded work, the more than capacity work burden creates negative mental attributes and immense stress. \nThe stress creating news from many parts of the World like wars, children abuse, drug abuse etc., can cause stress. The over concern about the body health and assuming to have many diseases themself is another cause. \nThis is due to the lack of proper knowledge and easy accessibility to information anytime using the internet.\u00a0\nThe attitude and behaviour of colleagues seniors and our attitude and behaviour to others are also factors of stress creation. Lack of satisfaction and never-ending run behind worldly desires creates stress in some people. The strained relationships or inability to create good relationships also cater to stress formation.\nStress manifests in the body by various responses like anxiety, depression, anger, fear, grief, emotional outbursts, insomnia, restlessness, headache, muscle fatigue, sweating, hypoglycaemia, hypertension, respiratory discomforts, and succumbing to addictions like alcohol, tobacco, substance abuse etc.\u00a0\n \nStress in Ayurvedic View\n \nAyurveda says \n\u2018mana shareeram parasparam anuthapayathi\u2019\n means body and mind are interrelated.\n Discomforts to the body can create stress in the mind and vice versa. Similarly, diseases also affect the body and mind simultaneously.\n Five Indriyas (sense organs) due to their karma affects the mind, leading to stress both to mind and body. \nSo the major way to keep stress in control is to control the mind and Indriyas and divert them from stress creating an environment.\n Still, it\u2019s impossible for everyone, so we have to adopt various measures to keep the mind and sense organs detached from stress aetiologies. \nAlso, treatment plans are needed to tackle stress-related disorders of both mind and body. \nAyurveda describes the stress and various diseases, especially psychiatric diseases like Unmada and Apasmara. \nKlama Is the word commonly used for Stress in Ayurveda, although mentioned with many other names in different contexts.\u00a0\n \nHow to Manage Stress in an Ayurvedic way?\n \n \nComplete rescue from stress for the whole life is not possible with any treatment systems.\n An integrated approach to tackle the stress conditions is needed. \nAyurvedic treatments, Yoga therapy, counselling, hobbies, travelling, etc., can positively impact stress and related conditions.\u00a0\nThe foremost thing is to have awareness about stress and why it needs to be tackled.\n Persons having this awareness needs no treatment but can rescue themself easily. \nAt times, support and care during stress and counselling pave the way for redemption from stress in some persons.\u00a0\nAs far as Ayurveda is concerned, \u2018Satwavajaya chikitsa\u2019 or treatment to win over the mind is advocated at first. \nCounselling, care, support, protection, rehabilitation etc., comes under this. \nThen treatments like snehapana in which medicated ghritha/ ghee like Kalayanakam ghritham can be used wisely to treat stress-related psychological manifestations. \nDue to its properties, ghee reaches the brain easily and increases intellect, and longevity helps greatly reduce stress. \nMedicines to treat insomnia can be advised. \nTreatments like Shirodhara or the application of oils on the forehead in a narrow stream can be done.\n Oils selected can have the property of cold potency.\n It helps in calming down and bring the patient back to normalcy. \nOther treatment options like Shiro abhyanga (head massage), pada abhyanga (foot massage) or full body abhyanga can also be adopted. \nThese treatments stimulate the nervous system. Internal medications can also be prescribed.\u00a0\nYoga\n\u00a0The next major line of treatment is the adoption of Yogic practices.\n Daily engagement in Yoga, especially Pranayama, is highly beneficial to reduce stress and improve concentration. \nYoga advises daily dhyana or chanting, proper concentration in karma, expansion of awareness, asanas or postures, etc., in tackling stress and the most important part- \nPranayama.\n Various pranayama and Yoga asanas are to be practised, which have immense potential in reducing stress. \nYoga mostly focuses on correcting mental attributes and, from there, correcting physical abnormalities.\n Karma yoga advocates work in bliss and action in relaxation. Jnana yoga advocates spiritual discourses, health awareness, counselling etc.\n Rajayoga advocates expansion of awareness, dhyana, group activities and devotional sessions.\n Kundalini yoga advocates Pranayama or breathing exercises. Hatha yoga advocates various postures or asanas, cardiopulmonary exercises, dietary modifications etc.\u00a0\nMind Relaxing Activities\nIndulging in mind relaxing activities like travelling, reading, pet care, household works, hobbies, hanging out, being surrounded by well-wishers, daily exercises, praying, religious worships, writing, hearing songs, eating healthy food, etc. simple ways to tackle stress.\u00a0\nBeing healthy by a proper daily regimen\nBeing physically healthy is another important aspect of stress management. \nIf illnesses are there, the stress will be an ever companion in our life. Warding off diseases by maintaining a healthy body is necessary. \nProper adoption of Dinacharya or daily regimen, Ritucharya or seasonal regimen etc., as mentioned in Ayurveda, helps this objective. Ayurveda exclusively mentions \u2018Sadvritta\u2019 and \u2018Aachara Rasayana\u2019 to maintain mental health to optimum levels.\u00a0\nVagbhata, a pioneer seer in Ayurveda, mentions in his coveted book Ashtanga Hridaya that adopting a line of approach to everything in our life is the middle path only. \n\u2018Sarva dharmeshu madhyama\u2019\n. Such an approach itself can help escape from stress creating factors. In a fast-moving society like ours, adopting a middle path has tremendous advantages. Stress will be an inevitable phenomenon, but how we tackle it is the key to success in life.\n \nayurvedic Treatment packages for Stress or Destress package in Kerala\n \n \nOur stress, anxiety and depression management package are one of the \nbest Ayurvedic treatments in Kerala.\u00a0 \nThe Package includes Herbal Medicines and therapies like \nAbhyanga, Shiro abhyanga, Pada abhyanga, Shirodhara, Thalapothichil\n, etc.\nThe duration of the treatment is 7 days to 21 days depending upon the condition.\u00a0\nThere will be a special diet and meditation or yoga therapies as part of the treatment.\n \nMake an Enquiry\n \nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nName \n*\nEmail \n*\nNumber\nSubject \n*\nComment or Message \n*\nSubmit"}

Tinnitus is often considered a symptom of an upcoming meniere disease attack. \nTinnitus can occur intermittently or persistently, affecting one or both ears.\nWhile it is commonly associated with hearing loss, Tinnitus can also result from other health conditions or lifestyle factors. \nThe causes of Tinnitus are unclear, but most people with it have some degree of hearing loss. \nTinnitus is rarely associated with a serious medical problem and is usually not severe enough to interfere with daily life. \nHowever, some people find that it affects their mood and ability to sleep or concentrate. In severe cases, Tinnitus can lead to anxiety or depression.\n \nSymptoms of Tinnitus\nThe symptoms of Tinnitus can differ from person to person. \nSome people may experience roaring, buzzing, ringing, whistling, humming, clicking, hissing, or squealing sounds. \nThe sound may be mild or loud, low or high in pitch. It may appear and disappear or remain constant. \nMoving your head, neck, or eyes or touching specific parts of your body might cause tinnitus symptoms or momentarily alter the quality of heard sound. \nThis is known as somatosensory Tinnitus.\nIn most cases, Tinnitus is subjective, meaning you can only hear sounds.\n\u00a0In rare circumstances, the sound pulses regularly, frequently in sync with your heartbeat. In certain circumstances, a doctor may be able to hear the sounds using a stethoscope, and the condition is referred to as objective Tinnitus. Objective Tinnitus frequently has an identifiable cause.\nCauses of Tinnitus\nWhile the exact causes of Tinnitus are not fully understood, it has been linked to the following:\nProlonged and Loud Noise exposure: Many people experience Tinnitus after exposure to loud noise in a workplace setting or at a sporting event or concert. Tinnitus is also the most common service-related disability among veterans because of loud noise they may have experienced from gunfire, machinery, bomb blasts, or other similar sources.\nHearing loss: Hearing loss, caused by aging or exposure to loud noise, is strongly associated with Tinnitus. Some people with hearing loss, however, never develop Tinnitus.\nMedications: Tinnitus can be a side effect of certain medications, especially if \nthey are\n taken at high doses. Medicines associated with Tinnitus include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin), certain antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, anti-malaria medications, and antidepressants.\nEarwax or an ear infection: Blockage of the ear canal by earwax or by fluid from an ear infection can trigger Tinnitus.\nHead or neck injuries:\u00a0 A head/neck injury can damage structures of the ear, the nerve that carries sound signals to the brain, or areas of the brain that process sound, causing Tinnitus.\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease: Tinnitus can be a symptom of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, an inner ear disorder that can also cause balance problems and hearing loss.\nTemporoMandibular joint problems: The joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull is close to the ear. Jaw clenching or tooth grinding can damage surrounding tissue, causing or worsening Tinnitus.\nTumor-related disorders. A vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) is a benign tumor on a nerve that leads from the inner ear to the brain. Acoustic neuromas and other head, neck, and brain tumors can cause Tinnitus.\nBlood vessel problems: High blood pressure, atherosclerosis, or malformations in blood vessels, especially \nif they are\n in or close to the ear, can alter blood flow and cause Tinnitus.\nChronic conditions: Diabetes, migraines, thyroid disorders, anemia, and certain autoimmune disorders such as lupus and multiple sclerosis are among the chronic conditions that have been linked to Tinnitus.\nWhat are the different types of Tinnitus? \nTinnitus can be classified into various types based on its nature, cause, and perception:\n\u00a0\nSubjective Tinnitus is the most common type, where only the affected individual can hear the sound. Issues in the auditory nerves or brain pathways often cause it.\nObjective Tinnitus: A rare type of Tinnitus where the sound can be heard by both the affected person and a healthcare provider using specialized instruments. It is typically linked to physical issues such as vascular abnormalities or muscle spasms.\nTonal Tinnitus: Characterised by a continuous or near-continuous sound with a defined frequency, often described as ringing or whistling.\nPulsatile Tinnitus: This type is synchronized with the individual\u2019s heartbeat and is often associated with blood flow changes in the ear or surrounding areas.\nSomatic Tinnitus: Triggered or worsened by physical movements, such as clenching the jaw or neck tension, indicating a connection with musculoskeletal issues.\nLow-Frequency Tinnitus: A deep, droning sound often described as humming or rumbling, which can be more disturbing due to its low pitch.\nAssociated Diseases\nMeniere\u2019s disease\nSensorineural Hearing Loss\nOtitis media (Middle ear infection)\nHypertension\nDepression \nAnxiety\n \nAyurvedic Concept of Tinnitus\nTinnitus is a clinical condition in which patients usually present with ringing sounds or sometimes distorted hearing and a sense of fullness in the ear.\n Tinnitus symptoms resemble Karnanada, and \na variety of\n \nKarnarogas\n (diseases affecting the ear) have similar etiology.\nWhen the \nVata dosha\n is aggravated in the channels of the ear, different sounds are frequently experienced.\n This condition is called \nKarnanada\n. When \nKarnanada\n is not treated correctly, it leads to deafness. \nKarnanada\n (Tinnitus) is described under 80 types of \nVata Vyadhi\n. \nSrotra\n (ears) is the seat of \nVata dosha\n. \nIndriyabhramsa\n (derailment of sensory organs) is one of the symptoms of \nVata vriddhi\n. Since the dosha predominance in this disease is Vata, the Vatahara treatment methodology indicated was found to be effective in the management of Karnanada (Tinnitus)\nThe treatment protocol for \nKarnanada (\nTinnitus\n)\n includes \nGhritapana\n (therapeutic intake of medicated ghee) and \nKarnapooranam\n (oil instillation in the ears). \nSamana Sneha\n with \nGuggulutiktaka Ghritam\n can be administered to alleviate the condition. The other necessary treatment procedure, \nKarnapooranam\n, carried out with \nKsharatailam\n, is specially indicated for \nTinnitus\n and deafness.\nAbhyanga\n (massage therapy) is one of the necessary treatment modalities for \nVata\n-oriented diseases. \nPichu\n (medicated oil application), one of the \nMurdhataila\n therapies, is said to be therapeutically better than \nAbhyanga\n and was performed here. \nMurdhataila\n is considered one of the best treatment modalities to pacify \nVata\n in the head region.\nHow to diagnose Tinnitus\nIf you experience \nTinnitus\n, first contact your primary care physician, who will look for earwax or fluid from an ear infection that may be clogging your ear canal. \nYour doctor will also ask about your medical history to determine whether an underlying ailment or medication causes your \nTinnitus\n.\nThen, you may be sent to an ENT. The ENT will ask you to explain the tinnitus noises and when they began, and they will examine your head, neck, and ears. \nYou may also be sent to an audiologist, who may test your hearing and assess your \nTinnitus\n.\nTinnitus is diagnosed through a combination of clinical examination and diagnostic investigations. Your ENT may prescribe imaging studies, particularly if your \nTinnitus\n pulsates. Imaging examinations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound can be used in tinnitus diagnosis. \nThe following procedures are commonly used to assess and confirm the condition:\nMedical History\nHistory plays a vital role in the diagnosis of \nTinnitus\n. Your physician may ask you specific questions for easy diagnosis.\nWhen did it start\n? \nWas\n it gradual or sudden onset? Gradually, it might suggest aging or exposure to noise, while sudden onset may be linked to trauma or loud sounds.\nIs it in one or both ears?\n: \nTinnitus in one ear could be due to earwax buildup and blockage or an infection.\nIs it constant or occasional?\n: \nConstant noise might be related to hearing loss, while episodes could indicate Meniere\u2019s disease.\nAssociated symptoms, if any?\n: \nSymptoms like giddiness or hearing loss provide additional clues regarding diagnosing Meniere\u2019s disease.\nPhysical Examination\nA doctor will look for visible signs and changes in the ears and surrounding areas.\nEar inspection:\nChecking for earwax buildup, infection, or damage to the eardrum.\nListening for sounds:\nA stethoscope is used to detect vascular (blood flow) issues around the neck or ear.\nPhysical Tests\nOtoscopy\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examination of the ear using an otoscope.\nNystagmus\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Observed only if there are associated acute attacks of vertigo.\nTuning Fork Tests\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These tests help differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss:\n\u25a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRinne Test\n: Positive, indicating sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear.\n\u25a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAbsolute Bone Conduction\n: Reduced in the affected ear.\n\u25a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWeber Test\n: Lateralised to the better ear in cases of sensorineural hearing loss.\nInvestigations\nPure Tone Audiometry\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reveals sensorineural hearing loss.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the early stages, lower frequencies are affected, showing a rising curve.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the disease progresses, higher frequencies become involved, resulting in a flat or falling curve.\nSpeech Audiometry\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demonstrates discrimination scores between 55\u201385% during symptom-free periods.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discrimination ability is significantly impaired during and immediately after an attack.\nSpecial Audiometry Tests\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Used to confirm the cochlear nature of the disease and differentiate it from retro cochlear lesions (e.g., acoustic neuroma):\n\u25a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nRecruitment Test\n: Positive for Meniere\u2019s disease.\n\u25a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSISI Test (Short Increment Sensitivity Index)\n: Typically better than 70% in one-third of patients.\n\u25a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTone Decay Test\n: Shows a decay of less than 20\u201340 dB, consistent with cochlear involvement.\nElectrocochleography (ECoG)\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diagnostically significant in Meniere\u2019s disease.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The standard ratio of summating potential (SP) to action potential (AP) is less than 30%.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Meniere\u2019s disease, the SP/AP ratio exceeds 30%, a key diagnostic indicator.\nImaging and Blood Tests\nIf the cause isn\u2019t clear, further tests may help:\nMRI or CT scans:\n Used if the \nTinnitus\n is in one ear or has a pulsating nature, suggesting a possible blood vessel or nerve issue.\nBlood tests:\n To rule out issues like thyroid problems, anemia, or high cholesterol.\nAdvanced Tests (If Needed)\nIn some cases, additional measurements are done:\nPitch and loudness matching:\n Comparing the tinnitus sound to external noises.\nMasking tests:\n Finding sounds that may temporarily reduce \nTinnitus\n.\nWhen to See a Specialist\nIf \nTinnitus\n is in one ear, pulsating, or affects daily life significantly, referral to an ear specialist (ENT doctor) is often recommended for advanced evaluation and treatment options.\nWhich are the parts affected? \nTinnitus primarily affects the auditory system, but its impact can extend to related regions:\nEars:\nThe inner ear, especially the cochlea and auditory nerve, is directly affected\nAuditory Pathways:\n Nerves and brain regions responsible for processing sound may show hyperactivity or abnormal signals\nTemporal Lobe:\nThis part of the brain processes auditory information and may be involved in tinnitus perception\nJaw and Neck:\nMuscle or joint dysfunction in these areas can exacerbate tinnitus symptoms\nCardiovascular System:\n In cases of pulsatile \nTinnitus\n, blood vessels near the ear may play a role.\nRisk Factors\nAge:\nAdvancing age increases the risk of \nTinnitus\n and hearing loss\nLoud Noise Exposure:\n Prolonged exposure to loud noises increases the risk of \nTinnitus\nLifestyle:\n Smoking, excessive caffeine, and alcohol consumption can add risk\nStress:\n Chronic stress and anxiety may worsen tinnitus symptoms\nOccupational Hazards:\n Jobs involving loud machinery or music increase susceptibility\nMedical Conditions:\n Hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disorders can increase the risk of developing \nTinnitus\nMedications:\nOtotoxic drugs\n, such as certain antibiotics and aspirin, may cause \nTinnitus\n.\nGenetics:\n A family history of hearing disorders can predispose individuals to \nTinnitus\n.\nAyurvedic Treatment for Tinnitus\nAyurvedic treatments focus on balancing the doshas to address the root cause of \nTinnitus\n. Common therapies include:\nGhritapana: \nTherapeutic intake of ghee for balancing vata aggravation\n \ncan \nbe beneficial for\n \ntinnitus\n. Medicated ghee formulated to target the head and neck region is used in treatment.\nKarna Purana:\nIt involves pouring warm, medicated oil into the ears to lubricate and nourish ear structures. This specialized therapy is considered \nextremely\n beneficial in managing and preventing the recurrence of \nTinnitus\n. \nNasya:\nNasya\n\u2013 Installation of medicated liquids through the nasal passage to clear toxins and improve auditory health\nKarna Pradesha Abhyanga and Sudation:\n Massaging and Perspiring the area around the ears, as well as full-body massage using herbal oils, can help manage and prevent the recurrence of \nTinnitus\nKarna Pichu:\nApplying thick cotton soaked in medicated oil/ ghee inside the ear gives oleation to the ear region, thereby balancing vata dosha and managing \nTinnitus\n. \nShirodhara:\nShirodhara\n \u2013 a Continuous pouring of herbal oils over the forehead region to balance the aggravated Vata dosha can aid in managing \nTinnitus\nVirechana:\nA detoxifying purgative therapy\n that cleanses the digestive system by administering laxative formulations that eventually help balance aggravated Pitta and\u00a0 Vata dosha.\nAyurvedic Herbs and Formulations Used for Tinnitus\nHerbs\nAshwagandha: Reduces stress and strengthens nerve health\nBrahmi: Improves cognitive function and reduces Vata imbalance\nHaritaki: Aids in detoxification and enhances auditory health\nBilva: Nourishes the auditory system and supports inner ear function\nDashamoola: A combination of ten herbs that balance Vata and reduce inflammation\nTriphala: Promotes detoxification and balances all three doshas.\nFormulations\nKarna Bindu Taila\nKsheerabala\u00a0 Taila\nApamarga Kshara Taila\nSarivadi vati\nPathyakshadhatryadi kashaya\nDiet and Lifestyle Recommendations\nAdopting a tinnitus-friendly diet and lifestyle can significantly complement Ayurvedic treatments:\nDiet Recommendations:\nInclude Nourishing Foods\n: \nAdd warm, easily digestible meals such as soups, stews, and cooked vegetables to your diet. \nAdd Essential Ingredients\n: \nIncorporate barley, wheat, rice, green gram, and ghee for a balanced and wholesome diet. \nStay Hydrated\n: \nDrink plenty of warm water and herbal teas to support overall hydration.\nHabits and Practices to Avoid:\nAvoid Harsh Practices\n:\n Refrain from brushing with harsh tools, taking head baths in ponds/rivers, and excessive exertion. \nSay No to Picking Ears\n:\n Avoid inserting objects into your ears to prevent irritation or damage. \nLimit Exposure to Cold\n:\n Avoid wandering in cold weather or engaging in activities that worsen the body\u2019s vata dosha. \nAvoid Aggravating Foods\n: \nAvoid vata-aggravating foods like spicy, oily, and processed items. \nReduce Noise Exposure\n:\n Limit exposure to loud sounds, especially earbuds; use wired earphones and ear protection when necessary. \nLimit Phone Usage:\n Phone use may be a risk factor for developing Tinnitus as it emits non-ionizing electromagnetic radiofrequency radiation (EMRFR).

Patches can range from few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas.\nDry and cracked skin. It may be associated with bleeding\nItching\nBurning sensation\nThickened, pitted or ridged nails\nSwollen and stiff joints\n \nCauses of Psoriasis \n \nHeredity \u2013 if one parent is affected, there is a 15% chance of the child getting the disease and 60% if both the parents are affected.\nConsumption of incompatible foods (such as fish and milk together)\nExcessive smoking\nAlcohol consumption\nMental stress\nPsychological trauma\n \nDifferent Types of psoriasis\n \n1.Chronic Plaque Psoriasis\nThis is the commonest form of psoariasis.\nIt causes dry, raised, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales.\nIt is associated with itching and is painful. These have a predilection for extensor surfaces, notably elbows, knees, and sacrum.\n2.Nail psoriasis\nIt can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth, and discolouration.\nIt can result in separation of the nail from the nail bed called onycholysis.\n3.Guttate psoriasis\nIt is marked by small, water drop shaped, scaling lesions on trunk, arms, legs, and scalp. It primarily affects young adults and children.\n4.Inverse psoriasis\nMarked by smooth patches of red and inflamed skin.\nMainly affects the skin of armpit, in the groin, under breasts, and around genitals.\n5.Pustular psoriasis\nPresents with pus-filled blisters appearing just hours after the skin becomes red and tender.

It does not spread from person to person due to the skin to skin contact.\nTouching a person with the disease does not transmit the disease.\n \nDiagnosis of Psoriasis\n \nPsoriasis is diagnosed by physical examination of the skin, medical history and relevant family health history.\nLab tests like microscopic examination of skin tissues from the skin biopsy are done sometimes.\n \nPsoriasis in Ayurveda\n \nSkin diseases are generally included in Kushta in Ayurveda.\nThere are eighteen types of kushta are described in Ayurveda.\u00a0\n7 among them are called mahakushta and 11 are called rudrakushta. . Psoriasis is correlated to Sidhmakushta.\nIt occurs due to an imbalance of two doshas- Vata and Kapha.\nDue to various causes, Vata and Kapha get vitiated and cause accumulation of toxins, these toxins get accumulated in deep tissues like rasa (plasma), rakta (blood), mamsa (muscle), lasika (lymph).\nThese toxins cause contamination of deeper tissues leading to psoriasis.\n\u00a0\n \nOur Ayurvedic Treatment Package for Psoriasis in Kerala\n \nTo treat Psoriasis it requires a minimum of 21 days treatment.

Its cooling property relieves stress and diseases like psoriasis have a very great psychological influence on patient leading to mental trauma. So treatments are intended to reduce stress.\nExternal applications cannot solely rely on and it is applied only after the treatment is done internally.\nDiet and regimen are equally important as medicines in case of psoriasis as chances of recurrence are high.\n\u00a0\n \n14 important things psoriasis patient should follow\n \nDo not drink cold water or take a bath or shower in cold water immediately after and coming out of the sun or after sweating.\nAvoid wearing thick clothes or clothes made from polyester material.\nTry not to sleep immediately after meals, especially during the daytime.\nAvoid working in extreme heat and walking in the sun.\nEat on time and drink water only after completing the meals.\nThose who sit in AC for an extended period must exercise for at least half an hour during the winter and rainy seasons.\nTake a bath in water boiled using medicinal herbs such as \nnalpaamaram\n ( which is a combination of the powder prepared from the barks of four trees: fig, \nithi\n, peepal, banyan )\nPsoriasis patients must have regular bowel movements. For this particular ayurvedic medicines can be taken. Also, try not to retain from passing urine when you feel the urge to urinate.\nDepending on the weather, especially during the summer, winter, and rainy seasons, some medicines should be taken as prescribed by the Ayurvedic doctor.\nA physician must carefully monitor the changes in our body according to the humidity in the atmosphere and the night\u2019s length.\nMandatory enema once a month as prescribed by the physician.\nIt is never a good idea to take a soap bath more than once a day. Limit the usage of soap. Regular use of pea powder is also not advisable for psoriasis patients, especially when itching is severe.\nEnsure at least six hours of uninterrupted sleep at night.\nPsoriasis patients with more stress should make sure their prayer times are accurate.

Transparent cost breakdowns, clean facilities, and holistic care throughout the treatment journey are also key factors to consider.\n \nTable of Contents\nAdd a header to begin generating the table of contents\nChoosing the right Ayurvedic treatment involves carefully considering various factors, including the quality of care, patient safety, accessibility, and the expertise of practitioners. \nThis document aims to guide you through the decision-making process, providing insights into what to look for when selecting an Ayurvedic treatment facility in Kerala. \nHere is a detailed breakdown of the facts you need to consider before choosing an Ayurvedic treatment that fits you:\n \nBook An Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n \nKnow More\nQuality of Care \nQuality of care is quintessential when selecting an Ayurvedic treatment facility. It involves the standards of treatment, the qualifications of practitioners, and the overall patient experience. \nIn Kerala,\n many \nAyurvedic hospital\ns and clinics adhere to rigorous treatment protocols that ensure the patient receives safe and effective care.\nOne of the most critical aspects of quality care is accreditation. The National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) is a \nrecognised\n body that sets standards for healthcare facilities in India. Hospitals accredited by NABH and other competent authorities have undergone a thorough evaluation process, ensuring they meet specific quality benchmarks. This accreditation not only enhances patient trust but also signifies that the facility \nprioritises\n patient safety and quality of care.\nWhen evaluating the quality of care, consider the following:\nTreatment Protocols: Ensure that the facility follows established Ayurvedic treatment protocols.\nPatient Outcomes: Look for data or testimonials regarding patient outcomes and satisfaction.\nStaff Training: Investigate the training and qualifications of the practitioners and support staff.\n \nPatient Safety \nPatient safety is critical \nwhile\n choosing an Ayurvedic treatment facility. In particular, safety protocols should be followed to protect the patients from potential risks associated with treatments.\nThis\n includes maintaining high hygiene standards, ensuring the proper handling of herbal medicines, and having emergency protocols \nin place\n.\nIn Ayurvedic practice, the use of natural herbs/mineral-based \ndrugs\u00a0 and\n herbal treatments can sometimes lead to adverse reactions if not administered correctly. Therefore, it is essential to choose a facility that prioritizes patient safety through the following measures:\nHygiene Practices: Ensure the facility maintains strict hygiene standards in treatment areas, waiting rooms, and patient accommodations.\nEmergency Protocols: Inquire about the hospital\u2019s emergency response procedures and whether they can access modern medical facilities in case of complications.\nPatient Feedback: Read reviews and testimonials from previous patients regarding their safety experiences. Positive feedback can indicate a commitment to patient safety.\nAccessibility \nAccessibility is a vital factor to consider when choosing an Ayurvedic treatment facility. The location of the \nhospital\n or clinic can significantly impact your treatment experience, especially if you require frequent visits for follow-up care or ongoing therapies.\nWhen evaluating accessibility, consider the following:\nLocation: Choose a \nfacility that is conveniently located\n, ideally within a reasonable distance from your home.\n \nThis\n can reduce travel stress and make it easier to attend appointments.\nTransport Options: Investigate the availability of public transport or shuttle services to the facility. Some hospitals may offer patient transportation services, which can be a significant advantage.\nMobility Considerations: If you have mobility issues, ensure \nthat the\n facility is equipped with ramps, elevators, and other accessibility features to accommodate your needs.\nTelemedicine Facility: Alongside the rise of telemedicine, some Ayurvedic practitioners may offer virtual consultations, which can enhance accessibility for patients who cannot travel easily. \nRange of Services \nThe range of services offered by an Ayurvedic treatment facility is crucial in determining whether it can meet your specific health needs. Ayurveda encompasses a variety of treatments, therapies, and wellness programs, each tailored to address different health conditions and promote overall well-being.\nWhen evaluating the range of services, consider the following:\nComprehensive Treatment Options: Look for facilities that offer a wide array of Ayurvedic treatments, including Panchakarma (detoxification therapies), herbal medicine, dietary consultations, and lifestyle management. A comprehensive approach can provide more effective and holistic care.\nSpecialized Services: Some Ayurvedic hospitals may have specialized programs for specific conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, stress management, Weight management, or skin disorders. If you have a particular health concern, ensure the facility has expertise in treating that condition.\nIntegration with Modern Medicine: Many reputable Ayurvedic facilities in Kerala integrate traditional Ayurvedic practices with modern medical approaches. This can be beneficial for patients who may require a combination of treatments for optimal health outcomes like Stroke.\nWellness Programs: In addition to treatment for specific ailments, consider facilities that offer wellness programs that focus on preventive care, rejuvenation, and stress relief. These programs often include yoga, Kutipraveshika rasayana/ kayakalpa chikitsa, meditation, and lifestyle and dietary guidance. \nPatient Experience \nPatient experience plays a significant role in the overall effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment. A positive experience can enhance your comfort, satisfaction, and willingness to adhere to treatment protocols. When evaluating patient experience, consider the following factors:\nStaff Interaction: The demeanor and professionalism of the staff can significantly influence your experience. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable staff can make you feel \nmore\n comfortable and supported throughout your treatment.\nComfort and Environment: The facility\u2019s physical environment should be welcoming and conducive to healing. Look for clean, well-maintained treatment areas, comfortable waiting rooms, and peaceful surroundings that promote relaxation.\nPatient Support Services: Facilities that offer additional support services, such as counseling, dietary advice, and wellness coaching, can enhance the overall patient experience. These services can help you navigate your treatment and lifestyle changes more effectively.\nFeedback Mechanisms: A facility that actively seeks and values patient feedback demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement. Look for hospitals encouraging patients to share their experiences and suggestions for enhancing care.\nCost-Effectiveness \nCost-effectiveness is an essential consideration when choosing an Ayurvedic treatment facility. While Ayurveda is often perceived as a more affordable alternative to conventional medicine, treatment costs vary significantly between facilities. To ensure you receive value for your investment, consider the following:\nTransparent Pricing: Look for facilities that provide clear and detailed information about treatment costs upfront. This includes consultation fees, therapy costs, and any additional charges for medications or follow-up visits.\nInsurance Coverage: Check whether your health insurance plan covers Ayurvedic treatments. Some insurance providers may offer partial or complete coverage for Ayurvedic therapies, which can significantly reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. Choose network hospitals if pricing is your next concern.\nPackage Deals: Many Ayurvedic hospitals offer package deals for wellness treatment programs, which can be more cost-effective than paying for individual services. Inquire about any available packages that may suit your needs.\nHospital Accreditation \nHospital accreditation is a quintessential factor in ensuring the quality and safety of Ayurvedic treatment. Accreditation from recognized bodies, such as the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH), signifies that a facility meets specific standards of care and operational excellence. Along with NABH, ISO certification is an added advantage.\nWhen considering hospital accreditation, keep the following points in mind:\nImportance of NABH Accreditation: NABH accreditation is a mark of quality assurance in healthcare. It indicates that the facility has undergone a rigorous evaluation process, ensuring compliance with established standards for patient safety, quality of care, and ethical practices.\nISO Certification: ISO Certified by Indian Register Quality Systems (IRQS) ensures that healthcare providers improve patient outcomes, reduce errors, and improve their processes. \nUsing ISO standards implies that healthcare organizations establish a global presence, adhere to regulations/guidelines, and \noffer better patient services \nat last\n.\nGMP Certification: GMP certification ensures that the medicines manufactured and processes used in the \nhospital\n meet specific quality and safety standards. It\u2019s a crucial step in ensuring the effectiveness and safety of Ayurvedic treatments, addressing concerns about quality control and standardization, especially for traditional medicines. This certification assures patients and stakeholders that the \nhospital\n adheres to rigorous quality control practices.\nVerification of Accreditation: Before choosing a facility, verify its accreditation status by checking the NABH or IAF websites or contacting the \nhospital\n directly. This step can help you avoid facilities that do not adhere to recognized standards.\nContinuous Improvement: Accredited facilities are often committed to constant improvement and quality enhancement. They regularly undergo evaluations and audits to ensure they maintain high standards of care. This commitment to quality can lead to better patient outcomes and a more reliable treatment experience.\nPatient Rights and Safety: Accredited hospitals must uphold patient rights and ensure safety protocols are in place. \nThis\n includes informed consent, confidentiality, and the right to receive quality care. Understanding these rights can empower you as a patient and enhance your overall experience.\nExpertise and Experience of Doctors and Staff \nThe expertise and experience of the doctors and staff at an Ayurvedic facility are crucial factors in determining the quality of care you will receive. When evaluating a facility, consider the following aspects:\nQualifications and Credentials: Research the qualifications of Ayurvedic practitioners. \nLook for degrees from recognized Ayurvedic colleges and any additional certifications \nor post-graduation\n and training in specialized areas.\n Experienced practitioners are more likely to provide effective and safe treatments.\nYears of Practice: Consider the years of experience the doctors have in the field of Ayurveda. Practitioners with extensive experience are often better equipped to handle complex cases and provide personalized care.\nContinued Medical Education (CME): Ayurveda is a dynamic field, and ongoing education is essential for practitioners to stay updated on the latest research and treatment methodologies. Inquire whether the facility encourages its staff to participate in workshops, seminars, and continuing education programs.\nPatient-Doctor Communication: Effective communication between patients and doctors is vital for successful treatment outcomes. Choose a facility where practitioners take the time to listen to your concerns, answer your questions, and explain treatment options clearly.\nHospital Infrastructure \nThe infrastructure of an Ayurvedic hospital plays a significant role in the quality of care and patient experience. A well-equipped facility can enhance the effectiveness of treatments and ensure patient comfort. When evaluating hospital infrastructure, consider the following:\nTreatment Facilities: Ensure the \nhospital\n has adequate treatment rooms, therapy areas, and equipment for various Ayurvedic treatments. Facilities should be clean, well-maintained, and designed to promote relaxation and healing.\nEmergency Care: While Ayurveda focuses on holistic healing, it is essential to have access to emergency care if needed. Check whether the facility has a dedicated emergency department or a protocol for referring patients to nearby hospitals in case of complications.\nPatient Accommodations: If you require an extended stay for treatment, inquire about patient accommodations. Comfortable rooms, nutritious Saatvik foods, and supportive services can significantly enhance your treatment experience.\nHygiene Standards: High hygiene standards are crucial in any healthcare setting. Ensure the facility follows strict cleanliness protocols \nin all areas\n, including treatment rooms, waiting areas, and restrooms.\nHospital Reputation \nThe reputation of an Ayurvedic hospital can provide valuable insights into the quality of care and patient satisfaction. A facility with a strong reputation is more likely to deliver effective treatments and prioritize patient well-being. When assessing a hospital\u2019s reputation, consider the following:\nCommunity Feedback: Research the \nhospital\u2019s\n reputation within the local community. Speak with people who have experience with the facility. Personal recommendations can be a reliable source of information.\nOnline Reviews: Explore online platforms where patients share their experiences and reviews. Websites, social media, and healthcare review sites can provide insights into the quality of care, staff interactions, and overall patient satisfaction.\nAccolades and Recognition: Look for any awards or recognitions the \nhospital\n has received for its services. Awards from reputable organizations indicate a commitment to quality and excellence in Ayurvedic care.\nProfessional Recommendations: Consult with healthcare professionals or Ayurvedic practitioners who may have insights into the reputation of various facilities. Their expertise can guide you toward reputable hospitals.\nAmenities and Facilities \nThe amenities and facilities offered by an Ayurvedic hospital can significantly impact your overall treatment experience. A facility that supports patient comfort and convenience can enhance your healing journey. When evaluating amenities, consider the following:\nComfortable Waiting Areas: Look for facilities with comfortable waiting areas that provide a relaxing environment for patients and their families. Amenities such as seating, refreshments, and reading materials can enhance the overall experience.\nDietary Services: Nutrition plays a vital role in Ayurvedic treatment. Inquire whether the hospital offers personalized/disease-specific \ndietary\n services. A healthy, balanced meal can significantly enhance your recovery process.\nRecreational Facilities: Some Ayurvedic hospitals may offer recreational facilities such as yoga studios, meditation rooms, or gardens. These spaces can provide relaxation and stress relief opportunities, which are essential components of holistic healing.\nPatient Support Services: Look for facilities that offer additional support services, such as counseling, wellness coaching, or educational workshops. These services can help you better understand your treatment and empower you to make informed decisions about your health.\nHygiene and Cleanliness: High hygiene standards are crucial in any healthcare setting. Ensure the facility maintains cleanliness in all areas, including treatment rooms, waiting areas, and restrooms. A clean environment is essential for patient safety and comfort.\nProximity to Your Home\nThe proximity of an Ayurvedic treatment facility to your home is an important consideration that can impact your overall treatment experience. Choosing a conveniently located facility can make it easier to attend appointments, especially if you require frequent visits for follow-up care or ongoing therapies. Here are some factors to consider regarding proximity:\nConvenience: A facility close to your home can reduce travel stress and make adhering to your treatment plan easier. This is particularly important for patients with mobility issues or chronic conditions requiring regular visits.\nTravel Time: Long travel times can be exhausting and may discourage you from attending appointments. Hence, considering a nearby facility can help you maintain consistency in your treatment.\nFollow-Up Care: After completing your initial treatment, you may need to return for follow-up visits or additional therapies. A conveniently located facility can facilitate these visits and ensure you receive the ongoing care you need.\n\u00a0\nAvoiding Quacks \nIn healthcare, particularly in alternative medicine like Ayurveda, it is essential to be cautious and avoid unqualified practitioners or facilities that may not adhere to established standards. Here are some strategies to help you prevent quacks and ensure you receive safe and effective Ayurvedic treatment:\nVerify Credentials: Always check the qualifications and credentials of Ayurvedic practitioners. Look for BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery) or BAM (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine) degree and \nPost graduation\n MD\u00a0 from recognized Ayurvedic colleges and any additional certifications or training in specialized areas. Practitioners should have a medical council license to practice Ayurveda in their regions.\nResearch the Facility: Investigate the reputation of the facility you are considering. \nLook for reviews, testimonials, and \ninformation regarding the \nhospital\u2019s\n accreditation status\n.\n Facilities that are accredited by recognized bodies, such as NABH, are more likely to adhere to quality standards.\nTrust Your Instincts: \nIf\n something feels off during your consultation or a practitioner makes unrealistic promises about treatment outcomes\n, trust your instincts\n.\n A reputable practitioner will provide honest information and set realistic expectations for your treatment.\nAsk Questions: \nDon\u2019t hesitate to ask\n about the practitioner\u2019s experience, treatment protocols, and safety measures.\n A qualified practitioner will be open to discussions on their approach and addressing any concerns you may have.\nHow to Choose the Right Treatment\nChoosing the proper treatment for any health concern involves a systematic approach to understanding your condition, evaluating available options, and selecting the most suitable treatment. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown on how to make an informed decision:\nIdentify Your Health Needs \nThe first step in choosing the right Ayurvedic treatment is to identify your specific health needs.

Setting clear goals will help you find the \nhospital\n that fits your needs.\nConsult a Healthcare Professional: Before pursuing Ayurvedic treatment, consider consulting with a healthcare professional who can help you assess your condition. A qualified practitioner can provide insights into whether Ayurveda suits your \nspecific\n health needs and may recommend complementary treatments.\nResearch About Your Condition: Educate yourself about your health condition in the health blogs on the respective healthcare providers\u2019 websites and how Ayurveda approaches it. Understanding the Ayurvedic perspective on your ailment can help you make informed decisions about the types of treatments that may be beneficial.\nConsult a Doctor \nConsulting a qualified Ayurvedic doctor\n is\n a \ncrucial \nstep\n in selecting the proper treatment.\n An experienced practitioner can assess your health needs, recommend appropriate therapies, and guide you through treatment. Here are some tips for making the most of your consultation:\nPrepare for the Consultation: Grab all the medical histories before your appointment, as this can help the doctor identify the root cause. Be open to providing information about your medical history, current symptoms, and any previous treatments you have undergone.\nDiscuss Your Goals: Communicate your health goals and what you hope to achieve through Ayurvedic treatment. This will help the practitioner tailor a treatment plan that aligns with your needs.\nAsk About Treatment Options: Inquire about the various Ayurvedic treatments available for your condition. A qualified practitioner should be able to explain each option\u2019s benefits and potential risks.\nRead the Health Blogs \nOnce you have identified your health needs and consulted with a practitioner, it\u2019s essential to research the available Ayurvedic treatment options. \nAyurveda offers a wide range of therapies\n, each\n designed to address specific health concerns.\n Here are some steps to help you explore your options:\nUnderstand Common Ayurvedic Treatments: One should be aware of common Ayurvedic treatments, such as Panchakarma (detoxification therapies), herbal remedies, dietary modifications, and lifestyle changes. Each treatment has its unique benefits and applications.\nExplore Specialised Therapies: Depending on your condition, you may benefit from specialized therapies such as Shirodhara (oil pouring on the forehead), Abhyanga (therapeutic massage), or Basti (medicated enema). Research these therapies to understand how they may help your specific health issues.\nConsult with Your Practitioner: Discuss the treatment options with your Ayurvedic doctor. They can provide insights into which therapies most suit your condition and explain how they work together to promote healing.\nRead Patient Experiences: Look for testimonials or case studies from patients undergoing similar treatments. Their experiences can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of specific therapies.\nEvaluate Safety of Treatment \nSafety is a concern when choosing Ayurvedic treatments. While Ayurveda is generally considered safe, evaluating the safety of specific therapies and practices is essential. Here are some steps to ensure the safety of your chosen treatments:\nDiscuss Potential Risks: During your consultation, ask your Ayurvedic doctor about any potential risks or side effects associated with the recommended treatments. A qualified practitioner should be transparent about the safety of their therapies.\nResearch Herbal Ingredients: \nIf\n your treatment involves herbal remedies\n, research the ingredients\n.\n Some herbs may interact with medications or have contraindications for specific health conditions. Ensure that your practitioner is aware of any medications you are currently taking.\nInquire About Hygiene Practices: Safety also includes hygiene standards in the treatment facility. Inquire about the facility\u2019s cleanliness protocols, especially in treatment areas where therapies are administered.\nMonitor Your Response: As you begin your treatment, consider how your body responds. If you experience any adverse effects or discomfort, immediately communicate this to your practitioner. A good Ayurvedic doctor will be attentive to your feedback and may adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\nFollow-Up on Progress: Regular follow-up appointments are essential to monitor your progress and ensure \nthe treatment is effective and safe\n.\n Your practitioner should assess your condition periodically and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan based on your response.\nSeek Emergency Care if Needed: While Ayurvedic treatments are generally safe, \nit\u2019s \nimportant\n to know\n when to seek emergency care.\n If you experience severe reactions or complications, do not hesitate to contact a healthcare professional or visit an emergency facility.\nKnow the Rates\nUnderstanding the costs associated with Ayurvedic treatment is necessary for making informed decisions. Treatment costs can vary significantly between facilities and therapies, so grabbing all the breakdowns is essential. Here are some steps to help you navigate the financial aspects of your treatment:\nRequest for a Detailed Breakdown: When considering a facility, request a detailed estimate of the costs associated with your treatment plan. This should include consultation fees, therapy costs, medications, and additional follow-up \nvisits\n charges.\nInquire About Package Deals: Many Ayurvedic hospitals offer package deals for comprehensive treatment programs. These packages can often be more cost-effective than paying for individual services. Inquire about any available packages that may suit your needs.\nCheck for Insurance Coverage: If you have health insurance, check whether your plan covers Ayurvedic treatments. Some insurance providers may offer partial or complete coverage for specific therapies, significantly reducing out-of-pocket expenses.\nUnderstand Payment Options: Inquire about payment options available at the facility. Some hospitals may offer flexible payment plans or financial assistance for patients who require ongoing treatment.\n2.6 Compare Hospitals \nOnce you have\n a \nclear-cut knowledge of \nthe information about\n various Ayurvedic treatments and facilities, you can compare them based on key factors that matter to you.\n A thorough comparison can help you identify the best option that fits you.

This can significantly enhance your comfort and ease of movement within the \nhospital\n.\nEmergency Facilities: While Ayurveda focuses on holistic healing, it\u2019s essential to have access to emergency care if needed. Check whether the facility has a dedicated emergency department or a protocol for referring patients to nearby hospitals in case of complications.\nRead Their Reviews \nReading reviews and testimonials from the hospital website and Google can provide valuable insights into the quality of care and overall experience at an Ayurvedic treatment facility. Here are some tips for effectively evaluating reviews:\nLook for Credible Sources: Seek reviews from credible sources, such as healthcare review websites, social media platforms, and forums dedicated to Ayurvedic treatments. These platforms often provide a range of patient experiences that can help you gauge the facility\u2019s reputation.\nEvaluate Overall Trends: Instead of focusing on individual reviews, look for overall trends in patient feedback. Consistent positive or negative comments about specific aspects of care can provide a clearer picture of what to expect.\nConsider the Context: \nRemember that\n individual experiences may vary based on personal circumstances. Consider the context of each review, including the patient\u2019s health condition, treatment type, and expectations.\nPay Attention to Specifics: Look for reviews that provide specific details about the treatment process, staff interactions, and the overall environment. Detailed feedback can help you assess whether the facility meets your preferences and needs.\nAsk for Recommendations: In addition to online reviews, consider asking friends, family, or healthcare professionals for their recommendations based on their experiences with Ayurvedic treatment facilities.\nTalk to the Concerned Person at the \nHospital\nDirect communication with the hospital P.R.O. and other staff can provide essential information and help clarify any doubts about the treatment process. Here are some tips for effectively engaging with the concerned person at the hospital:\nIdentify the Right Contact: When reaching out to the \nhospital\n, identify the appropriate person to speak with, such as the admissions coordinator, patient relations officer (P.R.O), or the Ayurvedic practitioner.

This will help them provide tailored information and recommendations that align with your needs.\nRequest Clarification: If you encounter \nany\n unclear terms or concepts, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for clarification. A knowledgeable facility will be happy to explain its processes and address any concerns you may have.\nAdditional Considerations \nIn addition to the primary factors discussed, several additional considerations can enhance your Ayurvedic treatment experience. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\nFollow-Up Care: Ensure the facility provides follow-up care after your initial treatment. Regular check-ins and assessments are essential for monitoring your progress and making necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\nLifestyle Modifications: Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes in achieving optimal health. Discuss with your practitioner any recommended lifestyle modifications that can complement your treatment, such as dietary changes, exercise routines, and stress management techniques.\nPatience and Realistic Expectations: Ayurvedic treatments often require time to show results. Be patient and maintain realistic expectations about the timeline for improvement. Communicate openly with your practitioner about your progress and any concerns.\nAuthentic Kerala Ayurveda Approach: Hospitals that follow traditional Kerala ayurveda \nchikitsa\n can be the best choice as it not only uproots the disease but takes a holistic approach to health, addressing not only physical symptoms but also mental and emotional well-being. \nConclusion\nAyurvedic Acharya Charaka quotes, \n\u201cOne can survive the thunderbolt of Lord Indra striking his head, but one cannot survive from an unknown medicine prescribed by an unqualified vaidya (quack).\u201d\n Be aware that quacks prevail in this era, which can worsen your condition; hence, choosing the right Ayurvedic treatment facility in Kerala involves thoughtful research, awareness of one\u2019s health needs, and a commitment to safe, authentic care. One can enjoy a genuine and accurate healing journey by prioritizing \nNABH\n and ISO 9001-accredited centers, qualified practitioners, and high-quality, GMP-certified medicines. Your Ayurvedic experience can be nurturing and transformative with the proper guidance and mindset."}

The debate between Ayurveda and allopathy is a timeless and never-ending controversy in the world of healthcare, and its answer often depends upon the context.\nIn this modern era of stressful life, one can benefit from both these systems as they provide complementary approaches to healthcare.\nHowever, Ayurveda, with its traditional knowledge, focuses more on preventive medicine, chronic disease management, and promoting overall wellness through holistic healing.\nAllopathy, on the other hand, is an essential healthcare system in this modern world, where people prioritize prevention less.\nIt provides critical care and emergency management and addresses complex cases where surgeries are mandatory.\nThis article provides you with an unbiased comparison of Ayurveda and Allopathy, exploring their approaches to disease management and prevention, their pros and cons, and the possibility of an integrated approach to address healthcare.\n \nTable of Contents\nAdd a header to begin generating the table of contents\nBook An Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n \nKnow More\nWhat Is Ayurveda?\nAyurveda derived its meaning from the literal translation of \u201c\nAyusho vedam\u201d \nmeaning \u201cthe science of life,\u201d is a traditional medicine system practiced in the Indian subcontinent since the pre-biblical era.\nIt is a science that deals with four types of ayus (life) viz \nhitam aayus\n (benevolent life), \nahitam aayus\n (malevolent life), \nsukham aayus\n (happy life) and \ndukham aayus\n (unhappy life).\nThe system\u2019s core strength is its holistic approach to health and disease using natural remedies derived from medicinal plants and minerals.\nIt lays its roots in self-discipline and modest living with high human values; the system strongly advocates a unique set of principles and guidelines on diet and exercise in daily healthy living.\nAyurvedic treatments focus on balancing tridoshas, viz Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, and rely more on herbal formulations, Panchakarma therapies (five-fold detoxification therapies), and dietary and lifestyle changes.\nIt integrates yoga and other traditional Indian philosophies like Sankhya and Nyaya Darshana into its principles.\nAyurveda views the human body as a microcosm (Mini Universe) and treats it accordingly, influencing both physical and mental health.\nIt also follows the principle that substances such as food and medications with similar qualities would cause the growth or increase of body tissues/ doshas. In contrast, those with dissimilar qualities would produce a decline or decrease.\nIn ancient times, Ayurveda served as the primary healthcare system in India, addressing everything from preventive care to complex ailments. However, with the rise of colonial rule in India and the introduction of Western medicine, Ayurveda suffered a strong setback.\nThe ancient scriptures were destroyed to prevent its growth as the primary source of healthcare.\nAllopathic medicine\u2019s strong research background, technological innovations, and speedy results overwhelmed people, paving the way for the decline of Ayurveda.\nNevertheless, India witnessed a revived interest in Ayurveda post-independence due to the strong efforts to conserve its cultural legacy.\nApart from this, the growing global interest in natural and holistic health, along with rigorous scientific research, contributed to Ayurveda\u2019s rebirth and has started to bridge the gap between traditional and contemporary medicine\n \nWhat Is Allopathy?\nThe term Allopathy derives its literal meaning from the Greek words \u201callos\u201d (against) and \u201cpathos\u201d (suffering), meaning that which is devised to oppose symptoms. Interestingly, this term was originally curated by the father of Homeopathy\u2014Samuel Hahnemann, in the 19th century to highlight that conventional medicine lacked sophistication and a preventive approach.\nIt originally described a system of medicine that treats diseases using remedies causing effects opposite to the symptoms.\nFor example, using anti-inflammatory drugs for inflammation or antipyretics for fever.\nThe term was coined to describe the difference in approach from homeopathy, but it eventually became synonymous with Western medicine.\nHowever, this usage is technically inaccurate as modern healthcare has evolved far beyond the principles of Allopathy.\nBy the mid-19th century, allopathic medicine began developing vaccines, antibiotics, and surgical techniques.\nThese advanced methodologies managed not only the symptoms but also the underlying causes of diseases, disproving the limited scope implied by the term Allopathy.\nAllopathy is now commonly known in modern medicine and is characterized by allopathic treatments using novel drugs, surgical procedures, and advanced diagnostic tools.\nAllopathic drugs are now popular as they target the specific symptoms or root causes of diseases, offering quick relief, especially in acute diseases like infections or injuries, which people long for, regardless of the side effects that they offer\n \nWhat Is Modern Medicine?\nModern Medicine, also known as Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), denotes the science that offers healthcare based on scientific research, clinical expertise, and patient values.\nIt covers a wide range of specialties, diagnostic tools, and treatments, including preventive care, pharmaceuticals, surgery, and advanced therapies like gene editing and immunotherapy.\nModern Medicine has surpassed the limitations of Allopathy by establishing scientific validation through rigorous research and personalized treatment plans tailored to individual patients, which Ayurveda has been practicing since its origin.\nIt incorporates a combination of preventive, curative, and palliative care. The terms \u201cAllopathy\u201d and \u201cModern Medicine\u201d are often used interchangeably, leading to confusion among patients and healthcare seekers.\nWhile Allopathy historically refers to the practice of treating diseases with remedies that produce effects opposite to the symptoms, Modern Medicine represents a broader, more advanced framework of healthcare built upon evidence-based practices, research, and technological innovation.\nNow, Ayurveda is evolving to be a Modern Medicine through rigorous research, clinical trials, and documentation to incorporate evidence-based practice and develop novel pharmaceuticals.\nEvolution of Ayurveda as a Modern Medicine\nIn recent years, Ayurveda has evolved significantly, aligning with modern healthcare paradigms. This transformation is driven by:\n \nScientific Validation\nNow, the Government bodies are promoting research in Ayurveda, and the researchers have explored the efficacy of Ayurvedic treatments through rigorous clinical trials.\nFor example, Turmeric\u2019s\u00a0 (Curcuma longa) active compound, curcumin, is widely studied and recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been validated for its adaptogenic benefits in stress management.\nNeem (Azadirachta indica) has been recognized for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.\nStandardization of Practices\nThe standardization of Ayurvedic formulations and procedures has made them more accessible and reliable in modern healthcare.\nRegulatory bodies like the AYUSH Ministry (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) in India have regulated the quality and safety of Ayurvedic medicines.\nTechnological Integration\nModern diagnostic tools and technology now support Ayurvedic practices.\nFor instance, digital platforms like Nadi Tarangini offer personalized Ayurvedic consultations based on nadi pariksha (pulse diagnosis) and individual \nPrakriti\n (constitution). Being an era of AI and machine learning tools, it helps analyze Ayurvedic datasets for predictive healthcare.\nGlobal Recognition\nAyurveda has gained international recognition in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, where they have started incorporating Ayurvedic principles into Western medicines through their integrative medicine programs.\nAyurveda is also a part of WHO\u2019s traditional medicine strategies, further boosting its global credibility.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has published several documents on Ayurveda, including WHO International Standard Terminologies on Ayurveda and WHO Benchmarks for the Training of Ayurveda. WHO benchmarks for the practice of Ayurveda.\n \nDifferences Between Ayurveda and Allopathy\nAyurveda and Allopathy are two unique systems of healthcare that have their journey towards healing, with their strengths and limitations. The major differences between Ayurveda and Allopathy are as follows:\nOrigin\nAyurveda: \nAyurveda originated around 5000 years ago. It relies on natural remedies, dietary guidance, and lifestyle practices to restore equilibrium and is a traditional medicine system practiced in the Indian subcontinent since time immemorial.\nIt has its base in the ancient Vedic scriptures \nRig Veda\n and \nAtharva Veda, \nhighlighting its existence in the Vedic period.\nAllopathy:\nThe term \u201callopathy\u201d was coined by Samuel Hahnemann, who also is known as the founder of homeopathy.\nModern allopathic medicine focuses on evidence-based medicine and owes its origin to Greco-Roman medicine and Northern European traditions.\nAllopathy is derived from Greek roots meaning \u201cother than the disease.\u201d Its foundation is laid on the sciences of anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, and the structure-function relationship between cells, tissues, and organs.\nIt uses advanced techniques, including novel pharmaceutical drugs, surgeries, and diagnostic methods for emergencies and the treatment of acute diseases.\nPhilosophy and Focus of Ayurveda and Allopathy\nAyurveda:\nThe core principle of Ayurveda is \u201c\nswasthasya swaasthya rakshanam, aaturasya vikara prashamanam,\u201d\n meaning preserving the health of the healthy and curing the diseases of the diseased through the balance of body, mind, and spirit.\nIt focuses on prevention and personalized care, using natural remedies like herbs, diet, and lifestyle adjustments to support long-term wellness.\nAllopathy:\nIt works on a scientific, evidence-based framework. Its main focus is on using advanced diagnostic procedures, allopathic medications, and surgeries to manage illnesses and their symptoms. The allopathic system focuses on faster outcomes and is more reactive than preventive, especially for acute diseases.\nLong-term effect of Ayurveda Vs Allopathy\nAyurveda:\nAyurvedic treatments focus on long-term effects.\nIt is not limited to immediate treatment of any disease and providing quick relief. As stated above, the root cause of the problem will be addressed and the overall quality of life of the patient will be better.\nAllopathy :\nIt helps provide instant relief and remove the ongoing problem, but the underlying cause remains untreated; thus, the cure is not permanent. If any further issues arise, they will be approached in the same way.\nOne way of understanding this is in terms of bacteria.\nAyurveda will permanently remove the bacteria from the system, while Allopathy will kill the bacteria, but traces of it could remain in the system and crop up later.\nHowever, side effects of allopathic medications can aggregate, especially with long-term use of pharmaceutical drugs.\nCost of Treatment , Ayurveda Vs Allopathy\nAllopathic medicines are more cost-effective compared to Ayurvedic medicines. However, in the case of diseases suggesting surgical management, Ayurveda can be cost-effective if the disease can be curable through Ayurveda.\nOne major reason is that Allopathic medicines are Government-regulated, and prices are kept in check. Ayurvedic treatments, however, do not have much Government control.\nManufacturers are free to set their prices, and often, the prices vary due to raw material scarcity.\nAyurveda is a herb-based treatment modality.\nThe same is true for procedures and treatments for Ayurveda and Allopathy.\nSide Effects\nAyurveda\n:\nAyurveda, being based on natural remedies, is generally regarded as having minimal side effects when used properly. Due to its nature, Ayurveda takes a long time to heal as opposed to Allopathy where the healing time is less and its effects are felt quicker.\nAllopathy:\nThe side effects can range from mild to severe due to strong, synthetic medications.\nTreatment Protocols- Ayurveda Vs Allopathy\nAyurveda\n:\nThe treatment focuses on the balance of tridoshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) through Panchakarma (internal detoxification), herbal remedies, and lifestyle changes. Chronic conditions like arthritis, diabetes, and stress-related disorders can be managed through Ayurveda, promoting long-term wellness.\nAllopathy\n:\nOffers quick solutions to both acute and chronic conditions through novel drugs and surgical interventions.\nIt is highly effective for life-threatening emergencies, severe infections, and conditions that require immediate attention, such as heart attacks, stroke, etc.\nThe focus is more on symptomatic management and less on addressing underlying imbalances in the body.\nPrevention and Chronic Disease Management\nAyurveda:\nFocus more on prevention through proper diet, lifestyle changes, and natural therapies. Ayurveda helps prevent the origin of the disease before it manifests.\nAyurvedic scriptures have clearly described the stages of diseases through a concept referred to as \nshat kriyakala (sixfold stages of diseases). \nThis concept is especially beneficial in identifying the stage of the disease and managing it before its chronicity.\nAllopathy\n:\nAllopathy tends to be more focused on treating conditions once they arise, offering acute care for immediate symptoms with a limited approach toward prevention. Allopathic medicine does provide excellent management options for chronic diseases like hypertension or diabetes but with larger side effects.\nAyurvedic Approaches to Diseases\nPerspective\nAyurveda aims for:\nswasthasya swaasthya rakshanam (\nPreserving the health of the healthy)\naaturasya vihara prashamanam\n (Curing the diseases of the diseased)\nIt achieves this through tridosha balance.\nDiagnosis\nAyurvedic diagnosis primarily focuses on darshana (inspection), sparshan (palpation) and prashna (interrogation).\nIt also uses Nadi pariksha (Pulse diagnosis), Mootra pariksha (Urine examination), Mala pareeksha (Stool examination), Jihva (Tongue examination), Shabda (Speech test), Sparsh (Palpation), Drik (Eye examination) and Akruti (Physique examination).\nAfter these examinations, it makes the final diagnosis based on one individual body constitution and lifestyle, emotions, and diet as well.\nTreatment\nTreatments in Ayurveda help to restore balance and detoxify the body, often combining therapies like:\nPanchakarma (detoxification therapies)\nHerbal medicines\nYoga and meditation\nDietary changes\nLifestyle modifications\nMedication\nAyurvedic medicines are derived from herbs, minerals, and natural compounds.\nPost-Treatment Routines\nAyurveda employs Rasayana medications as a post-treatment routine to prevent further repercussions.\nAdditionally, the patients are instructed to maintain a disciplined lifestyle, healthy diet, and periodic detoxification to sustain the benefits of the treatment.\nAllopathic Approaches to Diseases\nPerspective\nIn allopathy,\nDiseases are commonly regarded as entities (e.g., measles, smallpox, cancer, diabetes, etc.)\nDiseases are seen as entities that can be identified (\u2018diagnosis\u2019)\nTreatment is directed against disease entities (the diabetes is treated rather than the person with the diabetes)\nAppropriate allopathic medical treatment is the evidence-based application of drugs, surgery, and other methods.\nDiagnosis\nAllopathy relies on diagnostic tools like blood tests, imaging (X-rays, MRIs), and advanced screenings for accurate disease identification.\nTreatment\nTreatments focus on the disease mechanism and include:\nMedications are usually given to suppress the symptoms\nSurgical procedures for structural or organ-related conditions\nAdvanced therapies like radiation and chemotherapy for cancer\nMedication\nPharmaceutical drugs are formulated based on years of clinical trials and target-specific disease mechanisms.\nPost-Treatment Routines\nRecovery plans may include physiotherapy, ongoing medication, or lifestyle modifications to prevent recurrence.\nDiseases Better Managed by Ayurveda\nCertain conditions respond better to Ayurveda, which\nincludes:\nChronic digestive disorders (\ne.g., IBS, acidity\n)\nJoint pain and arthritis\nStress-related disorders (\ne.g., anxiety, insomnia\n)\nSkin conditions (\ne.g., psoriasis, eczema\n)\nLifestyle-related diseases (\ne.g., diabetes, obesity\n)\n \nDiseases Requiring Allopathic Attention\nAllopathy excels in addressing conditions that require immediate and intensive care; these include:\nInfectious diseases (\ne.g., bacterial infections, malaria\n)\nAcute emergencies (\ne.g., heart attacks, strokes\n)\nCancer (with chemotherapy, radiation)\nAdvanced organ failure (\ne.g., kidney dialysis, liver transplants\n)\nNeurological conditions (\ne.g., epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease\n)\nCertain curable genetic diseases (\ne.g., Hemophilia, Sickle cell disease\n \nPros of Ayurvedic Treatment\nAddresses the root cause of the disease, preventing recurrences\nTreats the person, not the disease\nFocus on mind, body, and spirit\nViews most diseases as psychosomatic, thus paving the way for a holistic approach addressing physical and mental health.\nEmphasis on prevention and lifestyle modifications.\nUse of natural remedies\nMinimal side effects.\nPersonalised treatment plan\nSustainable and eco-friendly\nCons of Ayurvedic Treatment\nOften slow in action, making it unsuitable for emergencies or critical care.\nLack of standardized formulations and clinical trials.\nGrowing quackery affects the credibility of science\nLimited efficacy in acute and emergency conditions\nLimited research compared to Western medicine\nLess accessibility\nPros of Allopathy Treatment\nFaster relief from symptoms and life-threatening conditions.\nTechnological advancements often pave the way for speedier disease identification and cure\nOften evidence-based, enhancing the credibility of the science\nEffective in managing acute and complex conditions.\nCost-effective and government-regulated standardized medicines\nMore accessible\nCons of Allopathy Treatment\nFocuses on suppression rather than cure\nIncreased risk of side effects from medications.\nRisk of drug interactions with other drugs and foods\nExpensive surgeries\nIncreased dependency on certain medications\nNo or limited focus on long-term prevention\nGrowing antibiotic resistance to overuse is an alarming situation.\nLoss of good gut bacteria, especially with antibiotics, metformin, antidepressants, laxatives, antacids, NSAIDs, etc.\nUnethical approach may often pose problems\nHectic schedules of allopathic doctors may make them miss out on proper diagnosis and minute details, leading to wrong treatment.\n \nIs Ayurveda a Better Preventive Measure Compared to Allopathy?\nYes, Ayurveda is a better preventive measure compared to allopathy as it has a strong foundation in preventive medicine.\nIt emphasizes more on preventive care, including diet, lifestyle changes, and natural remedies, making it an excellent choice for long-term wellness.\nOn the other hand, Allopathy primarily focuses on curing diseases and offers limited preventive strategies beyond vaccinations and screenings.\nDoes Ayurveda Give Instant Results?\nNo, Ayurveda typically works gradually, addressing the root cause of the diseases and promoting long-term wellness.\nAllopathy, on the other hand, provides instant results but with more chances of recurrence and side effects.\nHowever, some ayurvedic treatments offer relief within days; chronic conditions often require weeks or months of consistent practice and medication.\nAre There Any Diseases Ayurveda Cannot Treat?\nThis question is very subjective and depends on the condition/stage of the disease, the patient\u2019s health status, their decisions, and the consulting physician\u2019s expertise.\nUsually, there are no diseases in which Ayurveda cannot intervene. However, an integrated approach can work well in complex cases.\nAyurveda struggles with diseases that require immediate intervention, such as severe infections, organ failure, and advanced cancers.\nThere are cases reported where Ayurveda has even addressed emergency stroke and COVID-19 cases.\nHowever, this is limited as it depends on the consulting doctor\u2019s expertise.\nAdvantages of Ayurvedic Medicines\nMade from natural ingredients.\nMinimal side effects when properly used.\nFocus on treating the root cause.\nOften safe for long-term use.\nOffers sustainable, long-term solutions with minimal side effects.\nBuilds resilience through dietary and lifestyle adjustments.\nEffective in improving overall quality of life for chronic ailments.\nAdvantages of Modern Medicine\nImproved palatability and bioavailability\nRapid symptom relief.\nEvidence-based, with proven efficacy.\nBroad applications for emergencies and chronic diseases.\nConstant innovation and advancements.\nDoes Ayurveda Have Side Effects?\nAyurvedic medicines have minimal side effects when used properly under the guidance of a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner.\nHowever, misuse, self-medication, or poor-quality unregulated formulations can lead to complications such as heavy metal toxicity.\nSide Effects of Allopathy\nAllopathic drugs, with their long-term use, aggregate side effects such as mild allergic reactions to severe organ damage.\nProlonged use of antibiotics, for instance, can lead to resistance or gut health issues. Strong drug overdose cases are quite common here and can cause fatal incidents.\nThese quick-relief medicines might make you a person with an addiction, and you become prone to having an overdose of such drugs, which can cause organ failure or even death sooner or later.\nThe Long-Term Use of Ayurvedic Medicine\nAyurvedic medicines are generally safe for long-term use until and unless prescribed by a qualified medical practitioner.\nHowever, combining medicines with diet and lifestyle modifications followed by a gradual reduction in the dosage of drugs is recommended to minimise long-term side effects.\nThe Long-Term Use of Allopathy Medicine\nLong-term reliance on allopathic medicines can lead to dependency, resistance (in the case of antibiotics), and chronic side effects such as liver or kidney damage from painkillers or other medications.\nAntibiotic resistance is rising at an alarming rate.\nIf this situation continues to exist in society, it will create major havoc in the lives of individuals, more than that produced by the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe Possibility of an Integrated Approach\nAn integrated approach, combining Ayurveda\u2019s holistic and preventive philosophy with allopathy\u2019s scientific and emergency care methods in the most feasible way, would benefit humanity.\nHowever, this is possible only with a collaborative approach from the practitioners and patients.\nLack of awareness about the possibilities of both branches of medicine and their combined approach can be challenging in its way.\nThe integrative medicine approach\u2014using the preventive and holistic healing aspects of Ayurveda with the precision and technological advancements of Allopathy to provide comprehensive care is now emerging in India through the constant efforts from the concerned regulatory bodies.\nFor instance, the Ministry of AYUSH, in collaboration with the Directorate General of Health Services Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, has implemented the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) for health promotion, prevention and management of Non-communicable diseases or Lifestyle related disorders through its three research councils, namely, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) in various districts across the country.\nSeveral types of research are being conducted by CCRAS utilising the Ayurveda parameters & parameters of conventional bio-medicines as well.\nThe protocols are developed with an expert consultation of allopathic and Ayurveda experts. Research studies of Ayurveda intervention for efficacy and safety are conducted at hospitals such as AIIMS, New Delhi; BHU, Varanasi; KGME, Lucknow; and many other reputed institutions.\nCCRAS has conducted many feasibility operational studies to integrate Ayurveda and allopathy that have shown encouraging results.\nOperational study to explore the feasibility of integrating Ayurveda with the modern system of medicine in a tertiary care hospital (Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi) for the management of Osteoarthritis (Knee).\nRather than pitting Ayurveda vs Allopathy, the future of healthcare may lie in integrative medicine.\nThis can be done by, for example, incorporating Ayurvedic herbs alongside allopathic drugs for diabetes management, employing natural remedies like turmeric for inflammation, modern treatments for severe cases, and integrating meditation and yoga for better outcomes.\nConclusion\nThe debate of Ayurveda vs. Allopathy is not about choosing one over the other but about understanding their strengths and limitations. While Ayurveda excels in prevention, holistic care, and managing chronic conditions, allopathy shines in acute care, advanced diagnostics, and life-saving interventions. Both systems are essential and, when integrated thoughtfully, can revolutionise healthcare, offering comprehensive solutions for patients. Together, they remind us that health care is not just about science or tradition but about meeting individual needs with compassion and understanding.\nReferences\nhttps://bcmj.org/cohp/allopathy%E2%80%94-term-diminishes-profession#:~:text=The%20word%20is%20derived%20from,a%20process%20of%20diminishing%20symptoms\n.\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3087360/#:~:text=Ayurveda%20is%20an%20indigenous%20ethnic,from%20medicinal%20plants%20and%20minerals\n.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/allopathic-medicine\nhttps://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1696425"}

It combines herbal remedies, detoxification processes (Panchakarma), rejuvenation therapies (Rasayana), and lifestyle modifications to address pain holistically and prevent recurrence.\nMedications\nAllopathy\n: \nAllopathy treatment for back pain includes pain-relieving medications like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants like capsaicin, steroids, and other analgesics.\nAyurveda\n: \nAyurvedic back pain treatment utilizes herbal \npain\n and inflammation-relieving remedies like Shallaki (Boswellia), Ashwagandha, Guduchi, and Guggulu.\nTechniques\nAllopathy\n: \nEmploys therapies like IR radiation, Physiotherapy, injections, and surgical interventions when necessary. \nChiropractic therapies are also employed in some countries. \nAdvanced interventions, such as nerve blocks, epidural injections, or surgery, are options in chronic or severe cases.\nAyurveda\n: \nRelies on Panchakarma therapies, Ayurvedic parasurgical treatments like Agnikarma (thermal cautery), Raktamokshana (bloodletting therapy), oil massage (Abhyanga), yoga, and natural detoxification.\nTime for Results\nAllopathy\n: \nAllopathy Ensures faster relief from pain, especially in acute cases; however, in chronic cases, the underlying cause may lead to recurring pain or dependency on drugs.\nAyurveda\nAyurvedic treatment for back pain may take longer for visible results, as it works on the underlying cause, providing tissue repair and rejuvenation.\n However, it promotes sustainable recovery and long-term prevention of back pain.\nSide Effects\nAllopathy\nAllopathy Treatments may involve risks such as addiction, gastrointestinal issues, mood swings, metabolic imbalance, kidney issues, or dependence on opioids in severe cases and complications from surgery such as infections, nerve damage, or failure of the surgery.\nAyurveda\nAyurvedic back pain treatment has minimal side effects due to natural and holistic therapies. \nSome risks may arise if improper formulations or dosages are used without consulting a trained practitioner.\nPrevention of Recurrence\nAllopathy\nProvides temporary relief with medications; however, surgical management may provide relief. \nA preventive approach in allopathy can be through physical therapies and posture correction, but it doesn\u2019t always address the systemic causes of back pain.\nAyurveda\nA preventive approach through Rasayana and vajikarana chikitsa and diet and lifestyle modifications focuses on strengthening the body, improving posture, detoxifying the body, and maintaining balanced \ndoshas\n.\n \nCan Ayurveda cure all types of back pain?\nAyurveda can cure most back pain, except for \nlarger\n herniations and structural or congenital cases.\nThe nature and cause of back pain determine its treatability. \nCertain types of back pain, like Mechanical back pain \u2014 lumbar spondylosis, muscle strain, and herniated discs, and inflammatory backache, such as ankylosing spondylitis, can be cured through Ayurveda. \nIt can be addressed through \nvarious\n Ayurvedic therapies like abhyanga, Kati basti, Basti, etc, combined with diet and lifestyle modifications.\nIn case of traumatic injuries, allopathic treatment should be the first line of management, followed by Ayurvedic treatment as a restorative and regenerative therapy.\nIn case of structural issues, Ayurveda can help ease symptoms. However, conditions requiring surgery, like severe spinal deformities, may not be fully curable.\n Effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment for back pain\nAyurvedic treatment is effective in back pain as it uproots the underlying cause, promoting long-term wellness and preventing recurrence. \nIt helps manage muscle imbalances, joint stiffness, nerve compression, and systemic imbalances through intensive Ayurvedic therapies.\n Ayurvedic herbs, such as Ashwagandha, Shallaki, Rasna, Bala, and Guduchi, have pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties that help address the pain, providing quicker action. \nPanchakarma therapies, such as Basti, Virechana, Kati Basti, and Abhyanga, are highly effective for chronic or recurrent back pain. \nDiet and Lifestyle modifications such as \nincluding\n ghee, Vata balancing \nfoods,\n etc., yoga, pranayama, and practicing daily abhyanga or oil massage can also prevent a recurrence. \nAyurvedic treatments have been shown to reduce pain and improve mobility in patients with chronic lower back pain. \nThough it may take some time to show visible results compared to allopathic treatments, it can provide benefits in the long run.\u00a0\n However, be mindful that severe cases require allopathic interventions. \nHow Ayurveda ensures the Prevention of Back pain Recurrence\nAyurveda ensures the prevention of back pain through its ancient wisdom of rasayana and vajikarana chikitsa. \nIn Ayurveda, the prevention of back pain recurrence focuses on restoring and maintaining overall health through customized treatment plans. Rasayana therapy involves rejuvenating practices to promote longevity and prevent disease, which plays a vital role. \nRasayana Therapy focuses on the nourishment of sapta dhatus, which are hampered in degenerative conditions causing back pain. \nThrough rasayana chikitsa, these tissues are revived and replenished, promoting wellness. \nRegarding back pain, rasayana therapies with Lashuna rasayana, shilajit rasayana, etc, may help revitalize the spinal discs and nerves, which helps stop additional deterioration and prevent the ailments from recurring. \nWhen applied carefully and by the patient\u2019s Agni (Metabolism and Digestion), Sathmya (Adaptability), Bala (Disease Resistance), and Achara (Habits), Rasayana Therapy can benefit the patient immensely.\nAlong with rasayana chikitsa, Vajikarana Chikitsa is equally vital in spinal disorders as most of the patients with spinal disorders end up with sexual problems, whether it is Erectile dysfunctions, Premature Ejaculation, Loss of libido in males, Hormonal disturbances, Frigidity, Loss of sexual desire and Dyspareunia (Pain during Intercourse) in females. \nThese patients look for a sexual specialist again, but Ayurveda, through its specialty Vajikarana Chikitsa, treats not just the spine but also all future complications.\nConclusion\nAyurvedic treatments can be effective in reducing pain and improving functional ability in individuals with back pain.\nVarious studies suggest that panchakarma practices and internal medications can significantly reduce pain and enhance mobility. \nWhen combined with dietary and lifestyle changes, these therapies may also prevent recurrence by promoting overall balance and health."}
{"id": "doc_48", "content": "Is Ayurvedic medicine safe for the liver?\nCommon Questions in Ayurveda\n / By \n \n\t\t\t\tDr.Kavya Rejikumar\t\t\t\n\t\t / \n December 3, 2024 \n / \n12 minutes of reading\nAyurvedic medicines, like every medicine, can be poison for the liver unless it is taken mindfully in the right quantity and quality and for a specified duration.\nHowever, the side effects can be minimal in Ayurvedic medicines compared to the synthetic drugs used in allopathic systems of medicine. Every drug is poisonous for the liver, quotes eminent physician \nDr. BM Hegde\n, a Padma Bhushan awardee.\n\u201cThere is no pill for every ill, but there is an ill following every pill\u201d, he aptly quotes in his TedX talks, highlighting the potential risks for drug-induced liver injury.\nDrug-induced liver injuries are a growing concern as the liver is the prime organ responsible for metabolizing a majority of medications, where the first pass metabolism happens before it reaches the target organ.\nEvery drug is new to the liver and is metabolized as a foreign substance, adding a burden on this vital organ.\nRepeated exposure to high doses, prolonged use, or harmful additives can interrupt its functioning, leading to liver damage. Do any cancer medications kill the cancer cells without destroying the normal cells?\nThis is what happens with every drug, whether it be Ayurvedic or, allopathic or any other traditional system\n \nTable of Contents\nAdd a header to begin generating the table of contents\nBook An Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n \nOnline Consultation\nHow does Ayurvedic medicine work in our body?\nAyurvedic medicine\n works in the body through an interplay of core principles that govern the therapeutic action of drugs, especially on the \nthree doshas\n (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), the fundamental principles of the human body.\nAccording to Ayurveda, drugs exert their effects based on their inherent qualities, namely Rasa, Guna, Veerya, Vipaka, and Prabhava. These properties work synergistically to address specific pathologies.\nRasa (Taste)\nThis indicates the flavour of the drug, which is linked to its therapeutic action. For example, the bitter taste (Tikta Rasa) is known to have a cooling and detoxifying effect on the body, which can help balance Pitta dosha.\nGuna (Properties)\nGuna refers to the inherent qualities of a drug, such as its light, heavy, dry, moist, etc. These qualities influence how the drug affects the body and its doshas. For instance, a drug with dry quality can help reduce vitiated Kapha dosha, and those with moist quality can reduce vitiated Vata dosha.\nVipaka (Post-digestive effect)\nVipaka refers to the final metabolic impact of a drug. There are several vipakas for a drug, such as Madhura vipaka (sweet post-digestive effect), which is generally nourishing and balancing.\nPrabhava (Unique effect)\nPrabhava is the unique or special effect of a drug that cannot be explained solely by its Rasa, Guna, or Vipaka. For example, some herbs may have effects that are not directly related to their taste or properties, such as the calming effect of Ashwagandha.\nVeerya (Pot\nency)\nThis refers to the inherent strength of the drug\u2019s action, which can either be Ushna (hot) or Shita (cold). Potent drugs act more quickly and strongly, like Ushna herbs and Shita herbs , which are often used to balance Vata and Pitta Dosha respectively.\nApart from these principles, the timing, dosage, and method of administration are also important for a drug to act successfully.\nAyurveda uses formulations, such as Arishta and Asavas (Alcoholic Preparations) for extracting alcohol-soluble actives, Kwatha (decoctions) for removing water-soluble herbal actives, Vati (tablets), and Churna (powder) for concentrated actives, Ghrita (ghee), and Taila (oil) for fat-soluble actives, each designed to enhance the therapeutic action.\nThese processes enhance the absorption, stability, and action of the drug.\n \nWhy do some studies suggest that Ayurvedic medicines may not be good for liver health?\nSome studies associate Ayurvedic medicines with liver toxicity, primarily due to improper usage or quality concerns. Contributing factors include:\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) Supplements\n:\nAyurveda medicines are often tagged under\u00a0 OTC supplements, meaning they do not require a prescription to be purchased.\nThis can lead to inappropriate dosages and potential harm. Recently, there was an adverse event in Australia where a person was hospitalised due to severe lead poisoning after consuming Kamini Vidrawan Ras, an Ayurvedic formulation marketed as an \u201caphrodisiac \u201d and a \u201cpowerful stimulant\u201d to improve energy levels and vitality, 9News reported.\nThe authorities banned it immediately, stating that it had higher levels of lead and mercury.\nAccording to some sources, the tablets were reportedly bought from a Southeast Asian grocery store within the region but are believed to have been imported from overseas.\nKamini Vidrawan Ras is an Ayurvedic classical formulation containing Papaver somniferum or the opium poppy as one among the ingredients, which comes under Schedule E of The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, meaning they are poisonous drugs and require stringent quality control.\nDespite this fact, they are sold in grocery stores or online markets, making them more reachable to laypeople for consumption without a prescription.\u00a0\u00a0\nHerbo-Mineral Preparations\n:\nImproperly processed \nbhasmas\n (metallic preparations) may retain the metallic properties and can pose a risk for those consuming it.\nThis primarily happens due to the lack of stringent regulatory compliance.\nUnethical Sourcing of Herbs\n:\nHerbs grown in contaminated soils or harvested unethically can accumulate toxins such as lead and arsenic.\nAyurveda emphasizes sourcing from clean, sustainable environments to ensure quality.\nFor instance, \nashwagandha\n sourced from polluted lands may contain heavy metals that impact liver health.\nStrict adherence to traditional Ayurvedic sourcing guidelines, such as selecting herbs during specific seasons or times, is essential for safety.\nSimilarly, the species of the plant is also important. For instance, Giloy/Guduchi/Chittamruth, a drug that has entered into controversy, is claimed to be liver-damaging.\nThe fact is the difference in species and adulteration.\nThe medicinally valuable herb is \nTinospora cordifolia\n, while similar plants like \nTinospora malabarica\n and \nTinospora spinosa\n are available in the market as pollutants, and they are toxic.\nThese are harmful not only to the liver but to the entire body.\nThe drugs are described in Ayurvedic scriptures through their morphological characteristics; hence, it is easy for a qualified physician to identify the medicinal species, and they are documented according to modern standards these days for ease.\n \nWhat are the common ingredients in Ayurvedic medicines?\nAyurvedic medicines can be classified into\nHerbal\nHerbo-mineral\nAnimal Origin drugs,\u00a0\nHerbal\nHerbal drugs contain extracts of a variety of herbs in a group. This is what Ayurveda suggests; Ayurveda always advocates the use of a combination of drugs instead of a single drug formula.\nThrough this combination, the toxicity of certain herbs can be nullified and hence can be consumed safely.\nHerbo-mineral\nCompounds like mercury, lead, and arsenic are included but undergo rigorous purification to remove toxic properties.\nAnimal-origin drugs\nAnimal-derived ingredients: Ghee, Milk, Cow dung, Cow urine, Goat Urine, Gorochana(ox bile), horns of elephants, rhinos, etc.\nAyurveda\u2019s approach typically involves combining multiple herbs to balance efficacy and safety. For example, Wherever Vatsanabha(Aconitum ferox) is used in the formulation, Tankana Bhasma (purified borax) should be added in equal quantities to nullify the toxic effect of Vatsanabha. If Tankana is not available, Maricha (Piper nigrum) may be used in double the amount of Vatsanabha.\n \nAre there any harmful chemicals in Ayurvedic medicines that can affect the liver?\nThe presence of harmful chemicals in Ayurvedic medicines depends on factors like brand reliability and regulatory compliance.\nA good quality brand with GMP certifications may not contain dangerous levels of harmful chemicals.\nThe quality of medicines also varies from batch to batch and from medicine to medicine, even with reputed brands.\nHowever, a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner can suggest a patient with good quality brands.\nPeople claim Ayurveda contains heavy metals; yes, it does contain, but without the metallic properties.\nIt uses mercury, arsenic, lead, etc, but after thorough purification\n \nHas Modern medicine never used arsenic in its formulations?\nThe main remedy for syphilis in earlier times was derived from arsenic. Literally, the Ayurvedic herbo-mineral formulations are life-saving formulations, though they require stringent caution while administering. However, Newton\u2019s third law reminds us that every action has an equal and opposite reaction; likewise,\u00a0 for drugs, if it has an effect, there is a side effect.\nDo Ayurvedic Medicines Contain Heavy Metals?\nAyurveda often uses Heavy metals in the form of \u201cBhasmas\u201d for their therapeutic properties.\nHowever, the metallic nature of the metals is removed through specific purification methods, as mentioned in the classics of Ayurveda.\nThis purification process makes the drug therapeutically viable and more bioavailable than herbal medications.\nThe purification process includes trituration, immersion, boiling, etc. The purified metal/ mineral is then incinerated into a bhasma, which is an ancient method of naon-technology.\nIt is then used for preparing medications.\nIf not purified as per the principles of Ayurveda, these metals can be toxic to the body.\nBesides the metallic or mineral-origin products, the plant and animal-origin raw materials may, at times, contain Heavy metals.\nThis is because Heavy metals are naturally present in the environment and can accumulate in plants and animals through various sources such as soil, water and air.\nEven the water we consume has heavy metals like cadmium, arsenic, mercury, etc, if taken from improper sources. Hence, sourcing is what we need to focus more on.\nHow AYUSH Ministry Ensures Safety In Ayurvedic Medicines\nIt is crucial to ensure that the raw materials are sourced from reliable sources and tested for the absence of Heavy metals before being used in formulations.\nAlso, the metals/ minerals must be purified and processed and then taken into use.\nThe manufacturing must also be done by qualified and trained personnel under strict quality control guidelines.\nThe source of contamination can be polluted air, water and soil in which the drug grows, lack of purification of metals/mineral drugs as per the principles of Ayurveda, and excessive use of insecticides, herbicides and pesticides during extensive cultivation.\nAyush Ministry has regulated the permissible limits of heavy metals as:\nLead: 10 ppm\nMercury: 1.0 ppm\nCadmium: 0.3 ppm\nArsenic: 3.0 ppm\nThe safety can be ensured by\nAtomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)\nInductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES)\nInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)\nAmong these techniques, ICP-MS is the most ideal, accurate and reliable for measuring Heavy metals due to its superior detection limit, high throughput, wide linearity range and fewer interferences.\nDue to the potential health risks associated with Heavy metal contaminations, regulatory agencies in India and other countries have established guidelines and regulations for Heavy metal analysis.\nThus, heavy metal analysis is an important aspect of quality control for Ayurvedic medicines.\nHenceforth, Heavy metal analysis must be performed as part of routine quality control to ensure that the products are safe and free from toxic contaminants\n \nWhat precautions should be taken during Ayurvedic medication?\nAyurveda Pharmaceutics strongly recommends various safety aspects, like Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Field Collection Practices (GFCP) of medicinal plants and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for the preparation of quality-assured drugs.\nFactors like place, soil, season and time for collection of natural drugs also play a significant role in the quality, strength and purity of drugs. With the tremendous expansion in the use of natural products, safety and efficacy, as well as quality control of ASU drugs, have become pivotal concerns for both health authorities and the public in general.\nNonclinical evaluation of drug safety usually consists of standard animal toxicology\nstudies. Animal toxicity studies need to be carried out to assess the potential undesirable\npharmaco-dynamic effects of drugs on physiological functions in relation to exposure within\nthe therapeutic range.\nHere are some points one must take care of while taking Ayurvedic medicines for liver\nTake as per physician advice, as self-medication increases the risk of misuse and adverse effects.\nBeware of advice from quacks\nTake a Liver Function Test before consuming medicines\nRoutine blood checkup if you are doubtful about liver toxicity\nLook for products from reputed brands with GMP certification, and if they are outside India, FDA certification is mandatory for quality assurance. Some may claim false GMP certification hence talk to a physician before use\nMixing Ayurvedic and allopathic medicines without supervision can lead to harmful interactions.\nLong-term use of certain metal-based formulations should be avoided unless medically advised.\nAvoid medicines claiming magical cures for illnesses, although the government has laid strict rules through the Drugs and Magical Remedies Act.\nHow long can we safely consume Ayurvedic medicines?\nThe duration depends on the formulation and chronicity of the disease. Herbs like Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) and Triphala are generally safe for long-term use.\nHowever, heavy-metal-based formulations should only be used for short durations under strict supervision. Studies recommend periodic health monitoring during prolonged therapy.\nGenerally, formulas like kashayams are safe for weeks. However, rejuvenating formulations like Chyawanprash may be consumed for extended periods if monitored by a practitioner.\nChronic use of herbo-mineral formulations/ Rasa oushadhis requires strict oversight. Mostly, Ayurvedic medicines can be consumed safely for 41 days. However, for chronic use, consult a physician for more personalised advice.\nWhat should we consider while taking Ayurvedic medicines?\nPersonalised Dosages\n:\nBased on individual condition and chronicity of the disease, after careful analysis of the whole body through modern laboratory analytics.\nDietary Adjustments\n:\nCertain foods may enhance or inhibit the medicine\u2019s effects.\nFor instance, while consuming guggulu-based formulation, one must avoid foods that are hot in potency and sour in taste.\nAuthenticity Verification\n:\nCheck product certifications and avoid unregulated products.\nCan liver patients take Ayurvedic medicine?\nYes, Liver patients can benefit from specific Ayurvedic herbs; for instance, there are several liver protective formulations in Ayurveda, like kale (Andrographis paniculata), Bhumi amalaki (Phyllanthus niruri), Kutki (Picrorhiza kurroa) known for hepatoprotective properties.\nLaypeople may not be very aware of the parts that are to be used for a particular condition.\nFor example, the tender leaves of Bhumi Amalaki are recommended for jaundice as per Ayurveda.\nStill, if a person uses mature leaves, it may pose a risk to liver health, as when the leaves mature, there will be the addition of certain compounds and a reduction in the quantities of beneficial compounds.\nThis might pose a risk to humanity and is probably the result of self-medication.\nHence, one must take these medications depending on the condition of the disease, not by the advice of those having similar situations like you. A drug that is beneficial for one might be poison for another.\nHence, without medical advice, any medicine, whether herbal or allopathic, may exacerbate liver conditions.\nWhich plants and herbs can affect liver health?\nProlonged use of any herb and those tagged toxic under Schedule E of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act can harm the liver. These include\nAhiphena (Except seeds)\n \u2013 \nPapaver somniferum\nArka\n \u2013 \nCalotropis procera\nBhallataka\n \u2013 \nSemecarpus anacardium\nBhanga (Except seeds)\n \u2013 \nCannabis sativa\n (Except seeds)\nDanti\n \u2013 \nBaliospermum montanum\nDatura\n \u2013 \nDatura metal\nGunja (seed)\n \u2013 \nAbrus precatorius\n (seed)\nJaipala (seed)\n \u2013 \nCroton tiglium\nKaraveera\n \u2013 \nNerium indicum\nLangali\n \u2013 \nGloriosa superba\nParasika Yavani\n \u2013 \nHyoscyamus niger\nVatsanabha (Vishamushti)\n \u2013 \nAconitum chasmanthum\n, \nStrychnos nux-vomica\nShringivisha\n \u2013 \nAconitum chasmanthum\nIII.

These preventive treatments also boost immunity and prevent diseases.\n \nWhat is Karkidaka Chikitsa\n \nAfter the scorching sun of summer starts, the heavy downpour spreads the intoxicating smell of Mother Earth,\nKarkidakam\n, the month of Monsoon, comes in mid-July to August is considered the last month of the Malayalam Calendar (\nKollavarsham\n).\nKarkidaka month is called the month of epidemics, poverty, and misery due to heavy rains and floods in Kerala.\nTo overcome and protect ourselves from the inauspiciousness and ill effects of Karkidaka month, people observe and indulges in certain rituals and regimens.\nTaking a Karkidaka Chikitsa are some of the routines followed in the month of Karkidaka.\n \nImportance of Karkidaka Chikitsa in Kerala\n \nKerala has always been the hub of the age-old wisdom of life \u2013 Ayurveda. This explains, in short, why there are quite a handful of traditional Ayurvedic therapies to the assets of Kerala Ayurveda.\nKarkidaka chikitsa is one of these heritages of Kerala Ayurveda.\nDuring \nmonsoons\n, the sudden heavy rains after the intense heat in summer triggers infectious diseases and intensify individuals\u2019 existing degenerative conditions.\nAccording to Ayurveda, humans are considered the lowest Sareera Bala (innate immunity). This period also causes an imbalance in Tridoshas ( the three senses of humour \u2013 Vata, Pitta and Kapha, which are our body\u2019s functional units).\nAs the season impairs the Agni ( digestive fire) and lowers the immunity, Ayurveda instructs to follow strict dietary regimens and customized Panchakarma therapies to detoxify oneself, augment the Agni, and regain and maintain the balance of tridoshas.\nThis holistic approach of regularized diet and regimen, along with Panchakarma therapies during the season of karkidaka, is popularized as Karkidaka Chikitsa.\n \nThe holistic approach of Karkidaka Chikitsa Or Kerala Monsoon Treatment\n \nAyurveda emphasizes a conglomeration of diet, regimen, and treatment modalities to revitalize an individual\u2019s overall health in the month of Karkidaka.\nAn Ayurvedic physician decides the treatment protocols, diet, and no days of treatment needed for a person based on the individual\u2019s constitutional examination and health status.\n \nDiet in Karkidaka Chikitsa\n \nAgni is the essential factor that controls our body\u2019s overall metabolism and functioning. In the month of Karkidaka, the central element affected in our body is Agni.

Packages for different skin diseases may vary.\n \nMake an Enquiry\nConsult WIth Doctor\nThe skin is the body\u2019s first line of defense. This is why it is prone to infections and other issues. Eczema, psoriasis, acne, and rosacea are all conditions that can cause itchy skin. The most commonly prescribed \nCorticosteroid\n creams can have adverse side effects.

Ayurvedic medicine for the skin can help in effectively managing skin diseases.\n \nBook An Appointment Now\nOr Write to us for more details about our ayurvedic treatment for skin diseases\nWhat Does Ayurveda Says About Skin DIseases\n \nAyurveda is a system of medicine based on the principle of balance in the body. \nAccording to Ayurveda, imbalances in the body can lead to ill health and disease. \nAccording to Ayurveda, skin disorders can be caused by a lack of maintenance in any of the three Doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha). According to Ayurveda, any skin disorder occurs when the doshas and dhatus in our body are out of balance.\n Wrong diet and lifestyle are two leading causes of diseases that cause dosha vitiation. \nFollowing an incompatible\n\u00a0diet (virudhahara or food items of opposite nature) or an incompatible lifestyle contrary to a person\u2019s season or Prakriti (nature) results in toxins or poisons in our bodies. \nToxins accumulate and contaminate body tissues, skin, and other organs, resulting in skin diseases. Though imbalances cause skin disorders in all three doshas, pitta is the primary dosha.\nDietary or lifestyle issues could cause the imbalance.\nVata skin disorders, for example, cause skin dryness and a rough appearance. \nIt has the potential to cause cracks and fissures.\nPitta skin disorders can result in redness, burning pain, pus formation, ulceration, and fever. \nKapha skin disorders would result in white discoloration, itching, swelling, fluid retention, and other symptoms. \nSkin problems are not always superficial but rather the result of internal issues.\nThe accumulation of toxins in the body majorly causes skin diseases. \nIt is characterized by dryness, redness, itching, and skin scaling. The condition can be excruciating and debilitating.\n\u00a0\nAyurvedic treatment for skin disorders involves using herbs and other natural substances to detoxify the body and improve the function of the liver. \nIt also focuses on restoring balance in the body. Herbs and other natural substances, such as neem, and turmeric powder, can be used to detoxify the body and improve the function of the liver, which is an essential organ in removing toxins from the body. Massaging the skin with ayurvedic oils and applying natural poultices to the affected area can also treat skin diseases. \n\u00a0\nAyurvedic practitioners also recommend dietary and lifestyle changes to help manage skin diseases. Foods that are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, such as turmeric and ginger, are recommended to help reduce inflammation and support the body\u2019s natural healing processes. Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish, can also help reduce inflammation and improve skin health.\n\u00a0\nAll treatments aimed at curing skin disorders emphasize the treatment\u2019s complete penetrative and detoxifying abilities. Ayurveda treats skin problems by addressing the underlying causes; while Ayurvedic treatments may take longer to produce results, the emphasis is on restoring total body health. Cleaning (shodhana) treatments such as Vamana (Emesis therapy), virechana (Purgation therapy), and Raktamoksham are the primary treatment lines for all types of skin disorders. In addition, shamana oushadhis (oral medicine) are used for preventive and curative purposes.\nDetoxification therapies used to treat skin diseases are safe not only for patients but also for healthy people. Panchakarma Therapy promotes health, extends life, reduces weight, tones and rejuvenates the complexion, and revitalizes the mind, body, and spirit.\n \nBook An Appointment Now\nOr Write to us for more details about our ayurvedic treatment for skin diseases\nWhat are the Major Skin Diseases?\nMajor skin diseases, such as eczema, psoriasis, etc., can be uncomfortable and embarrassing and affect one\u2019s mental and emotional well-being.

L. S\n \nChief Ayurvedic Physician\nSaatwika Ayurveda\n \nConsult With Our Doctor\n \nBook an Appointment for consultation regarding Ayurvedic Treatment for Weight loss\n \n \nBook An Appointment\nLet's Check Some Facts\n \nWhat is Obesity?\n \nObesity is the condition in which abnormal growth of adipose tissues occurs either due to enlargement of fat cells or due to an increase in the number of fat cells.\nA combination of the above two also is possible.\nObesity is usually expressed in Body Mass Index (BMI).\nIf BMI is above 30 we can call it obesity. If BMI is between 25 and 30 the condition is termed as Overweight.\nIn the android type of obesity, fat distribution is mostly abdominal and in Gynoid type of obesity, fat distribution is more peripheral.\n \nAyurvedic concept of Obesity?\nObesity or\n sthoulya\n refers to a rise in body weight above the limits of skeletal and physical needs caused by an excess buildup of body fat.\nAyurveda views Obesity or \nsthoulya\n as one among the Santarpanottha vikaras or diseases due to excessive consumption of excess calories and one among the ashta ninditikara bhavas.\nA person with extensive growth of fat and flesh, pendulous buttocks, belly and breasts, along with a disfigured appearance, is called Atisthula, and the condition is termed Atisthaulya or Obesity.\nObesity is defined as the excess accumulation of energy in the body in the form of fat.\nObesity is an increase in BMI (Body Mass Index); more than 30 kg /m2 is also used for diagnosing Obesity.\nAyurveda considers heredity components (Bijadosha), medas (fatty tissue) and kapha dosha, besides dietetic, regimen and psychological factors as the causative factors. \nOther than these, Dhatvagni Mandya (Weak digestive fire at the tissue level) is considered to be the main cause besides other components in the etiopathology of Obesity or sthoulya.\n \nWhat is an ideal weight according to Ayurveda?\nUnlike modern medicine, which often relies on Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess overweight and Obesity, Ayurveda doesn\u2019t confine to an ideal weight system, as it varies from individual to individual. Instead, it focuses on achieving a healthy weight specific to each individual\u2019s unique constitution.\n \nHow to know the ideal weight?\nBody Mass Index (BMI):\u00a0\nThis popular medical screening tool calculates your body fat percentage by dividing your height by your weight. It is calculated by dividing the height in metres (m2) by the weight in kilograms (kg).\nWaist circumference:\n\u00a0Waist circumference can be an additional indicator of potential health risks. However, this tool should be interpreted by a medical practitioner in the context of your health profile.\nThe concept of ideal weight is frequently misguided as there is no so-called optimal weight.\u00a0\nIt is always recommended to remain healthy rather than going behind this idealism and concentrating only on a number on the weight scale.\nBefore adhering to an \u201cideal weight,\u201d consider the following important points.\nEach individual is different so is their ideal weight\n. This should be assessed after considering their metabolic rates, heart rate\n,\u00a0\nbody composition, and underlying medical history.\u00a0\nA healthy weight is not the same thing for different people.\nConsider your health first, as r\neaching for a perfect weight might not be a sustainable or all-encompassing strategy. Instead, stick to living with a healthy lifestyle.\nA balanced diet rich in low-density foods which include low-calorie, low-fat, high-protein diets,\u00a0\ncan assist you in reaching a healthy weight and general state of well-being.\nSticking to a consistent routine with regular exercise helps in m\naintaining general fitness.\nA good night\u2019s sleep\u00a0\ncan be the\u00a0\nfoundation of both physical and mental health.\nAlso, effective stress management techniques such as Yoga asanas, meditation and pranayama can boost your success rates in weight loss.\nSeek advice from registered practitioners, as this helps you get authentic remedies tailored to your needs and helps you\u00a0\nachieve an optimal state of health.\nThese are some reliable strategies for figuring out the appropriate weight; however, keep in mind that each person\u2019s results may differ.\nRemember, the best way to achieve and retain excellent health over the long term is to prioritise well-being and healthy lifestyle choices by recalling them.\n \nMajor Causes of Obesity\n \nThere is much reason for overweight. Some of them are related to lifestyle. Some of them are medical problems\nA major cause is eating habits. (Eating in between meals, over intake of sweets, refined foods and fats)\nComposition of the diet\nPeriodicity of the diet.\nSedentary lifestyle.\nPsychosocial factors lie emotional disturbances which can lead to overeating.\nFamilial factors.\nHormonal abnormalities like Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nLack of health awareness.\nUse of drugs like corticosteroids.\nGenetic factors.\nSmoking\nAlcoholism\nSymptoms Of\u00a0 Obesity\nIncreased BMI body size or weight, and lack of body flexibility are the major symptoms of Obesity.\n \nObesity and lifestyle\n \nObesity has a close relation with lifestyle.\nIf there is regular physical activity, it is highly protective against obesity.\nSedentary jobs, inactive recreation such as watching television or playing computer games, smartphone addictions, lack of playgrounds, general laziness etc. are contributory to the speedy development of obesity.\nAdoption of unhealthy dietary habits like snacks culture, unremitting use of caffeinated beverages etc are other lifestyle factors related to obesity.\n \nWhat are the Complications of Obesity or Diseases Associated with Obesity\n \n1. Heart disease\nCoronary artery disease is one of the leading causes of death in the World.\u00a0\nObesity is one such cause that increases the risk of heart disease by increasing blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides.\u00a0\nObese individuals have a higher fatty tissue deposition, which increases vascular resistance and might put extra pressure on the heart to pump blood throughout the body.\n2. Stroke\nStroke is a condition that has a devastating effect on the body when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts.\u00a0\nObesity could lead to an increased risk of stroke due to increased blood pressure and cholesterol.\n3. Type 2 diabetes\nBeing obese is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes as it increases both insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction.\u00a0\nThis is especially true when fat is distributed more in the abdomen and intra-abdominal area, as well as when it is stored in the liver and muscles.\n4. High blood pressure (hypertension).\nIncreased visceral body fat puts undue pressure on the arteries, causing an increased blood pressure.\nMoreover, Obesity causes an increased inflammatory response in the body, which might damage the blood vessels, contributing to increased blood pressure.\n5. Cancer\nIncreased risks for certain cancers can be linked to Obesity, including colon, kidney, oesophageal and prostate cancer in men and post-menopausal breast, ovarian, uterine and gallbladder cancer in women.\n6. High cholesterol\nIncreased fatty tissues in the body lead to increased amounts of free fatty acids for delivery to the liver.\u00a0\nBeing insulin-resistant also increases the levels of free fatty acids in the blood.\u00a0\nThis might cause increased inflammation in the body and can lead to low HDL cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides (dyslipidemia).\n7. Gallbladder disease\nObesity leads to fat infiltration into multiple organs, and infiltrated adipose tissue releases a large number of cytokines that cause organs like the gallbladder to malfunction.\n8. Sleep apnea\nSleep apnea is a condition that causes you to stop breathing repeatedly during sleep. Obesity is a major risk factor for sleep apnea, as it can narrow the airway.\n9. Osteoarthritis\nOsteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that causes pain and stiffness in your joints. Obesity increases your risk of osteoarthritis by putting extra stress on your joints.\n10. Gout\nGout is a type of arthritis that causes sudden and severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints. Obesity is a risk factor for gout, as it can increase your levels of uric acid in the blood.\n11. Mental health problems\nObesity is linked to an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Excess body fat and unhealthy eating habits raise inflammatory markers. This increased inflammation can lead to a higher chance of developing depression, and it also plays a role in immune system function.\n \nOther major risks and conditions due to overweight\nIncreased morbidity\nHyperlipidaemia\nPolycystic ovarian disease\n and infertility.\nLiver diseases like fatty liver\nSexual problems like erectile dysfunction\nJoint diseases like \nosteoarthritis\n of knees, hips, and lumbar spine\nLow backache\nVaricose veins\nAbdominal hernia\nDepression and disability\nSocial isolation\nLower work performance\nBreathing disorders\nCosmetic issues\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\n \nAyurvedic Treatment for Obesity or Weight Loss Programme in Kerala\n \nAyurvedic Treatment for Weight loss is aimed to reduce excess weight\u00a0\nAyurveda recommends \u2018guru\u2019 foods (foods which causes heaviness with even low quantity intake) in low quantities for an obese person.\nMedicines and food which have the property to lean the body are to be given.\nThe wise use of Kashayas and Choorna which induce Agni Bala or digestive power can be used.\nExternally rooksha treatments like Choorna pinda sweda, udwarthana etc can be used.\nAs supportive measure Yoga can be practiced along with internal and external medications.\nThe use of Kanmada Rasayana is advised in obesity.\nIncrease in Agni Bala, gradual diversion to a healthy diet and lifestyle is the method adopted.\nMajor treatment procedures to reduce weight are\nUdwarthana\n or powder massage\nDhanyamla dhara\nChoorna pinda sweda\nSteam bath\nYoga therapy\nVirechana\nUdwarthana\n\u00a0Udwarthana or powder massage is the most effective external treatment to reduce weight.\nVarious medicine choornas are used for the purpose, mostly Kolakulathadi Choorna and Triphala Choorna.\nIn this procedure patient\u2019s body is massaged in seven different positions by making him or her lie in a massage cot or droni.\nUdwarthana is said to have the following properties.\nReduces Kapha dosha\nReduces medas or excess fat\nMake the body strong\nGive lustre to the skin\nNormally one course of treatment includes seven days, and another course can be taken after a gap of one week.\nIt is proven to be the best procedure to reduce fat.\nUdwarthana as a passive exercise can be used in dinacharya.\nEarlier in households, the powder of green gram was used instead of bath soap.\nIt gives the dual result of the lustre of skin and reduction of fat.\nWe can use Triphala powder daily for 10-20 minutes for udwarthana.\nThis will help to keep the body healthy and prevents obesity.\nUdwarthana massage is usually done in the Pratiloma direction or opposite to the direction of body hairs. This gives enough strokes on fat cells and helps to reduce them.\nUdwarthana helps to soften the skin and removes the dead cells of the skin.\nIt improves blood circulation and helps to avoid bad odour too. It acts as a detoxifier too.\nOur weight reduction programme is the best packaged \nAyurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n for obesity.\n \nMake An Enquiry\nPanchakarma therapies included in Ayurvedic weight reduction Treatment.\nVamana\nVamana\n helps in expelling the excess Kapha and Pitta from the\u00a0\nbody.\u00a0\nIn Vamana fitness of the patient was taken with proper care, and cardiac and respiratory fitness were also done with proper measures.\u00a0\nAfter the Vamana procedure, significant results were observed, and there was a reduction in the weight of patients up to 7 kg.\nThe BMI of the patient was also reduced along with the skin\u00a0\nfold measurements.\u00a0\nJust like after cutting a tree, its flowers, fruits, etc., get destroyed; in the same way, after doing proper Vamana Karma Kapha is eliminated\u00a0\nfrom the body, thus alleviating all the diseases produced due to\u00a0\nit. Madanaphala is best for Vamana Karma as it has very few complications.\u00a0\nMadhu and Saindhva do liquefaction and scraping of Kapha. Indrayava was also taken as it is the best therapeutic emetic agent with no complications.\nVirechana\nVirechana is defined as the removal of unwanted toxic materials from the body in a downward direction, i.e. through guide marga (anal way). Sthoulya is one of the santarpanjanyavyadhi and shows Bahudoshavastha.\u00a0\nDifferent shodhana modalities have been used for the treatment of sthoulya, such as virechana, basti, etc.\u00a0\nVirechana is easy among them and has fewer complications. Secondly, virechana is one of the aptarpantmak treatments for the santarpanjanya vyadhis.\u00a0\nDue to these reasons, virechana is a good procedure for\nthe treatment of sthoulya(Obesity), which gives the best results. Virechana can also be administered in Atisthoulyaupadravas.\u00a0\nSimilarly, vataroga is mentioned in the upadravas of Ati Sthoulya.\u00a0\nThere is a combination of meda, kapha and vata in the sthoulya; hence, virechana, with the help of the eranda tail, is administered.\nLekhana vasti\nThe basti is the panchakarma procedure where the formulated medications are pushed inside our body through anal opening, vaginal opening or through the urethral opening.\u00a0\nAccording to modern science, this can be compared with the enema procedure.\u00a0\nFor the treatment of the sthoulya, lekhana basti is the preferable basti as in this type of Basti; the excessive doshas are scraped out of the body.\n \nUse of Herbal formulations in Ayurvedic weight management\nVarious single drugs can be used to induce weight loss, including Guduchi, Vidanga, Musta, Guggulu, etc.\u00a0\nAlso, Ayurveda has formulated certain formulations that aid in stimulating metabolism and aids in removing fatty deposits from liver cells.\u00a0\nFormulations such as Trikatu, Navak Guggulu, Triphala Guggulu, Vidangadi churn, Takrarishta, Navayasa laura, and Arogya Vardhini vati are some among them.\nThese herbs have been research-backed for their weight loss effects.\nMusta (Cyperus rotundus)\nStimulates lipolysis in adipocytes, suggesting that this medicinal plant contains activators of \u03b2-adrenoreceptors (AR).\u00a0\nVarious studies demonstrated that C. rotundus tuber extract can bind to these receptors and help to induce thermogenesis, thereby reducing weight gain.\nHoney\nCertain hormones such as leptin, ghrelin and peptide YY are recognised for their role in modulating satiety, appetite, calorie intake, energy expenditure and body weight.\u00a0\nThere is little research evidence suggesting the influence of honey on appetite-regulating hormones, including leptin, ghrelin, and peptide YY. A recent study found that rats given honey had much lower levels of leptin than rats fed sucrose.\u00a0\nSimilarly, as compared to a sucrose-containing meal, honey was found to delay postprandial ghrelin release and improve total peptide response in healthy adult individuals.\nHoney\u2019s fructose content may contribute to its ability to modulate appetite-regulating hormones.\n\u00a0Although the processes by which honey reduces weight gain are not entirely understood, current research suggests that honey may reduce weight gain by modulating appetite-regulating hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, and peptide YY.\u00a0\nFurthermore, based on data that revealed no significant difference in food efficiency ratio (FER) between sucrose- and honey-fed rats, lower food intake may contribute significantly to reduced weight gain in the honey-fed rats.\u00a0\nFructose and oligosaccharides included in honey may also contribute to lower body weight and food intake in honey-fed rats.\u00a0\nFurthermore, existing information suggests that honey may help with body weight loss by reducing protein digestion and absorption while increasing faecal nitrogen excretion.\u00a0\nGiven the overwhelming evidence that honey raises plasma antioxidants and reduces oxidative stress in tissues, the antioxidant action of honey may also contribute to reduced weight gain.\nGuggulu\nGuggulu encompasses Guggulsterone, a bioactive component that works as an antagonist at the nuclear receptor farnesoid x receptor (FXR), a critical transcriptional regulator for cholesterol and bile acid balance.\u00a0\nA recent study found that Guggulsterone increases the expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP).\u00a0\nThis rate-limiting efflux transporter removes cholesterol metabolites and bile acids from the liver.\u00a0\nThis upregulation might be mediated by the activating protein 1 (AP-1) signalling pathway.\u00a0\nPossible pathways for Guggulsterone\u2019s hypolipidemic action include FXR antagonism and increased BSEP expression.\nVidanga\nBody weight growth, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, serum parameters, and myocardial oxidative stress levels were all examined.\u00a0\nERE (Embelia ribes ethanol extract) had a protective effect against body weight growth, visceral fat buildup, and high blood pressure.\u00a0\nThe extract administration resulted in a considerable drop in blood levels of leptin, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, whereas HDL-C levels improved.\u00a0\nFurthermore, ERE therapy reduced cardiac lipid peroxidation while increasing antioxidant levels in obese animals.\u00a0\nThese findings indicated ERE\u2019s anti-obesity potential by suppressing body weight growth, reducing lipids, improving insulin and leptin sensitivity, and increasing antioxidant defence.\n \nHow does ayurvedic treatment for weight loss work?\nThe Ayurvedic approach to Obesity\n has a different perspective.\nNidana parivarjana, or avoidance of causative factors, is considered to be the \nfirst line of approach.\n\u00a0\nThe Ayurvedic treatment for Obesity in Kerala focuses on \u2018Shamana\u2019 (Palliative) treatment and \u2018Samshodhana Chikitsa\u2019 (Purificatory procedures), all strictly under the supervision of a Registered Ayurvedic Physician.\nShamana (Palliative) Treatment involves fasting or \u2018Langham\u2019, the use of digestives to augment fat metabolism or \u2018Ama Pachan\u2019, dry medicated powder massage or \u2018Ruksha Udwartan\u2019, consumption of a diet low in calories and high in nutrients, recommendation of physical exercises and mental work.\nSamshodhana Chikitsa (Purificatory Procedures) includes \u2018Panchakarma\u2019 procedures such as therapeutic emesis or \u2018Vaman\u2019, therapeutic purgation or \u2018Virechan\u2019, medicated enema or \u2018Lekhan Vasti\u2019. These therapies should be done according to Vyadhibala\u00a0\n(strength of the disease)\u00a0\nand Dehabala (strength of the patient). Ayurveda emphasises the use of langhana and rukshana therapies as the more suitable management for Obesity.\u00a0\nUnder langhana includes samshodhana and samshamana therapies. All obese patients with excess doshas and more strength should be treated with panchakarma therapies.\u00a0\nIncluding Vamana (Medicated Emesis),\u00a0\nVirechana (Medicated Purgation), Lekhana visit etc.\u00a0\nAs a syndromic illness, Samshodhana treatment is highly suggested for obese individuals with stamina and power.\u00a0\nRuksha, Ushna, and Tikta Basti (Enema with dry, hot, and bitter medications) are also recommended.\u00a0\nRuksha Udvartana (Dry powder massage) is a Bahya Shodhana (External therapy) recommended for the treatment of Obesity.\u00a0\nThe primary objective of obesity therapy is to alleviate Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, particularly Samana Vayu, Pachaka Pitta, and Kledaka Kapha (humours), as well as to reduce Medodhatu by raising Medodhatvagni. Administration-heavy ingredients that promote catabolism along with Vata-Kapha-Meda alleviating properties are considered ideal for Sanshamana therapy.\u00a0\nThe usage of\u00a0\nlaghu\n\u00a0\u00a0(Light), Ushna (Hot), Ruksha(Dry), Tikshna (Sharp) properties etc. are suggested for Obesity management\u00a0\nas they possess Lekhaniya (scraping action), Medonashaka, Kaphanashaka and Sthoulyahara actions.\nAlso, the administration of medicines also should be considered, i.e. intake of medicine before meals is insisted for Krishikarana (losing weight) purposes.\u00a0\nDrugs in Paste form are attributed to have Karshana (To reduce\u00a0\nfat) and Durjara\u00a0 \n(Difficult to digest) properties and the same is advocated in the \nmanagement of Obesity.\u00a0\nThe use of Avishadkara, Mridu, and Sukhakara Aushada in gradually increasing doses with caution is advised for\u00a0\nsthoulya\u00a0\nmanagement.\n Furthermore, it has been emphasized to examine Agnibala (Strength of the Digestive fire), Dehabala, Doshabala (Strength of the vitiated bodily humors), and Vyadhibala before fixing the dose and length of therapy of Obesity.\n \nMake An Enquiry\nPrecautions to be taken before ayurvedic weight reduction Treatment\nSpeak with an experienced Ayurvedic practitioner prior to beginning any Ayurvedic weight loss program. After evaluating your unique demands and state of health, they will decide if this strategy is best for you. The following general safety measures should be followed prior to beginning an Ayurvedic weight loss program:\nBe truthful while discussing your medical background with your doctor. Let them know about any prescription drugs you use, any illnesses you may have, and any allergies you may have. They can use this information to develop a safe and efficient treatment plan for you.\nDescribe any recent wounds or surgeries:\n\u00a0\nAny recent operations or injuries should be disclosed to your practitioner as they may impact your eligibility for specific therapies.\nStop smoking and excessive alcohol intake:\n\u00a0Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption might impair the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatments and be hazardous to your overall health.\nAdjust your diet:\n\u00a0\nDietary modifications are frequently included in an Ayurvedic weight loss plan. Your practitioner may advise you to adopt a specific diet based on your dosha (body type). This could include eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while minimising processed foods, sugary drinks, and harmful fats.\nManage stress:\n\u00a0\nStress can promote weight gain and make it difficult to decrease weight. Ayurvedic practitioners frequently advocate stress-reduction strategies like yoga, meditation, and pranayama (breathing exercises) to reduce stress.\nBe patient:\n\u00a0\nAyurvedic weight loss is a slow process that prioritises long-term health and well-being over short cures. To see benefits, you must be patient and follow your treatment plan consistently.\n \nDos and Don\u2019ts During Treatment\nDo\u2019s:\nMild to moderate activity, depending on individual capabilities\nRegular 30-minute brisk morning walk\nTake low-fat, low-calorie foods\nIncrease your protein intake to help you go longer periods without eating\nInstead of frying veggies, steam, boil, or bake them\nTo avoid food cravings, eat often and in modest portions\nDrink skimmed milk rather than full milk\nFor drinking, always use warm water\nInclude lemon in your diet and beverages\nConsume nutritious meals including oatmeal, walnuts, salads, bitter gourd (Karela), drumstick (Shigru), barley (Yava), wheat, green gram (Moong dal), honey (Madhu), Indian gooseberry (Amla), pomegranate (Anar), snake gourd, and skimmed buttermilk\nInclude cabbage in your everyday meals. It prevents the conversion of carbohydrates to fat.\nDon\u2019ts:\nAvoid sedentary behaviors\nAvoid oversleeping\nAvoid watching television when eating meals\nAvoid alcohol consumption and smoking\nCut down vegetables high in carbohydrates, such as potatoes and grains\nReduce increased consumption of sugary and sweet items, dairy, fried and fatty meals, fast food, and excessive salt.\nPost-treatment Regimen\nFocus on whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\nAvoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of added sugars and unhealthy fats.\nStaying hydrated can help control hunger and increase feelings of fullness.\nPay attention to how much you\u2019re eating, and use smaller plates or containers to help control portions.\nGet enough sleep. Lack of sleep can lead to weight gain by affecting hormones that regulate hunger and fullness.\nAim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.\nConsistency is the key. Weight loss requires making healthier choices most of the time, so aim for gradual and sustainable changes.\nAvoid fad diets. Rapid weight loss is often not sustainable and can lead to health problems.\n \nImportance of consulting an Ayurvedic doctor before weight reduction treatment\nAyurveda is a science that focuses more on personalised approaches to every aspect of health in an individual.\u00a0\nThis approach is necessary as it helps people get tailored weight loss treatments as each individual is different, so should their treatment.\u00a0\nIt helps in identifying and addressing the root causes of imbalances, such as excess weight, digestive issues, hormonal imbalances, or lifestyle factors.\u00a0\nAyurvedic practitioners also consider holistic health assessment, addressing stress-related or emotional factors that may contribute to unhealthy eating habits or weight gain.\n\u00a0Ayurveda doctors help you follow specific dietary guidelines, herbal supplements, and lifestyle modifications to promote overall well-being. Ayurvedic weight reduction treatments typically emphasise natural and sustainable methods, including dietary changes, herbal formulations, and lifestyle adjustments.\u00a0\nSeeking advice from an Ayurvedic doctor helps prevent potential side effects and guides sustainable lifestyle changes that promote lasting weight management and overall well-being.\u00a0\nThis personalised, holistic, and natural approach can lead to more effective and sustainable outcomes for health and wellness.\n \nConsult With Doctor\nImportance of Diet and Excercise in Weight Reduction\n \nThis is evident from the reasons for obesity mentioned earlier.\nAs obesity is mostly a lifestyle disease proper diet and regular exercise, yoga and Ayurvedic regimen is very important in day-to-day life.\nTo maintain healthy weight corresponding to age and height all these things are to be followed judiciously.\nSome natural methods of weight reduction are\n\u00a0Daily intake of pure honey lightened with fresh water\nUse of buttermilk daily\nUse of Triphala powder daily with honey\nUse of fibre containing vegetables daily like the pith of plantain\nuse of foods with rooksha quality like green gram, horse gram etc.\nAvoiding or reducing non-vegetarian foods and switching to a vegetarian diet helps some to reduce weight.\nOf course, it\u2019s our care to our own body is the major thing which can prevent diseases especially lifestyle diseases.\nObesity due to lifestyle is also preventable and curable.\n\u2018Where there is a will there is a way\u2019.\n\u00a0\n \nHow Should I maintain the weight after treatment, the importance of follow-ups\nMaintaining an adequate weight following an ayurvedic weight loss treatment is often challenging and critical for preserving health benefits and avoiding weight rebound.\u00a0\nHere are some weight-maintaining tips and the significance of follow-ups:\nMaintaining Weight:\nFollow a balanced diet rich in proteins and low on carbs\nAvoid sugary drinks\nExercise regularly for at least 30 minutes\nPractice stress management techniques such as yoga asanas, meditation, and pranayama\nEat mindfully, considering your appetite\nStay away from hunger pangs\nMaintain gut health by increasing probiotics\nMonitor your weight on a regular basis\nEmbrace yourself with supportive friends and family who promote healthy lifestyles\nImportance of Follow-ups:\nPreventing weight regain is the cornerstone of lifelong weight management, for any weight loss techniques.\nIt is important to modify or intensify treatment, where necessary, to overcome weight regain.\u00a0\nConsider each patient\u2019s weight history and current situation to determine a follow-up plan for treatment.\nFollow-up appointments should include an evaluation of the patient\u2019s current meal plan, eating habits and physical activity.\u00a0\nMeasurements taken can be used as part of this evaluation process.\u00a0\nIf the activity plan is monitored and modified accordingly, this is associated with improved outcomes.\nFollow-up appointments allow physicians to encourage self-monitoring and allow tracking of a patient\u2019s progress by using self-monitored data.\nRegularly plan your visits to keep you motivated and any modifications if needed at any stage of your weight loss journey.\nKeep a close check on your health concerns during your weight loss journey, too.\nRemember that the weight loss journey is a long-term goal. Proper weight management tips, along with regular follow-ups, make you achieve this successfully.\n \nRelated Posts\n \nDiet\n\t\t\t\tAyurvedic Diet Plan For Weight Loss\t\t\t\nDr.Salini L S\n \n\t\t\tAyurvedic diet plans for weight loss focus on balancing the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) and improving digestion.\u00a0 These diets include warm, low-calorie foods, such ...\t\t\nRead More \u2192\nWeight Management\n\t\t\t\t10 Easy ways to reduce weight\t\t\t\nDr.Salini L S\n \n\t\t\tMany of us are worried about what to do to lose weight.

{"id": "doc_60", "content": "What is An Ayurvedic Diet\nDiet\n / By \n \n\t\t\t\tDr.Kavya Rejikumar\t\t\t\n\t\t / \n December 22, 2024 \n / \n20 minutes of reading\nAn Ayurvedic diet is a dietary approach rooted in the ancient Indian science of Ayurveda.\nIt drives one to eat in harmony with their body\u2019s constitution (Prakriti), current imbalances (Vikriti), and the natural rhythms of nature. \nAn Ayurvedic diet goes beyond mere nutrition; it combines the qualities of food, individual needs, and mindful eating to support overall health and well-being.\n \nTable of Contents\nAdd a header to begin generating the table of contents\nBook An Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala\n \nConsult with Our Doctor\nAyurvedic Approach to Diet\nAyurveda views diet as one of the primary pillars of health.\n According to Ayurvedic principles, food is medicine, and consuming it in the right way can maintain health, prevent diseases, and restore balance to the body. \nThis approach focuses on Pathyahara (dietary discipline), which includes eating appropriate, balanced, and wholesome foods while avoiding incompatible food combinations, overeating, and under-eating.\nThe guidelines are designed to meet the needs of each individual, taking into account their body type (Dosha), season (Ritu), and lifestyle (Dinacharya). Foods are categorized based on their taste (Rasa), potency (Virya), post-digestive effect (Vipaka), and impact on the doshas.\nPathyahara (dietary discipline) involves more than just reducing salt, spice, and sour foods or avoiding meat and fish. \nIt encourages consuming nutritionally appropriate and condition-specific foods daily. Lately, Ayurvedic practitioners have started emphasizing these principles, which is a positive development. \nThe scientific foundation of guidelines like \u201cDinacharya\u201d and \u201cRitucharya\u201d should be understood and applied not only by Ayurvedic practitioners but also by individuals seeking holistic health.\nAyurveda\u2019s relevance continues to grow as it offers practical, scientific solutions to many modern health issues. \nBy promoting balanced diets and educating people about the importance of nutritional health, we can create a society that is less dependent on medications and more focused on preventive care, enhancing both individual health and the relevance of Ayurveda in today\u2019s world.\nIf one eats food strictly according to the prescribed quantity for each meal, it may help keep lifestyle diseases at bay and lead to a life of health and well-being. \n\u201cM\u0101tr\u0101\u015b\u012b sarvak\u0101la\u1e43 sy\u0101t m\u0101tr\u0101 hi pravartik\u0101 m\u0101tr\u0101 dravy\u0101\u1e47yapek\u1e63ante gur\u016b\u1e47i ca lagh\u016b\u1e47i ca gur\u016b\u1e47\u0101mardhasaubhitya\u1e43 lagh\u016bn\u0101\u1e43 n\u0101tityapath\u0101 m\u0101tr\u0101 pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 nirdi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e43 sukha\u1e43 t\u0101vat j\u012bryati (A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga hrdaya m\u0101tr\u0101\u015b\u012bt\u012byam adhyaya).\u201d\nOvereating, under-eating, and unbalanced eating are issues that unknowingly occur in everyone\u2019s life today due to personal, professional, family, and societal circumstances. \nPeople now eat not for nourishment but to satisfy their cravings. Eating habits such as excessive food intake due to the influence of alcohol consumed as an appetizer before meals or snacking on unhealthy items in front of mobile phones or laptops after meals constitute unbalanced eating (Sama\u015banam) and under-eating (Adhy\u015banam). Additionally, skipping meals during official work or eating more or less than the usual amount is considered improper eating (Vi\u1e63ama\u015banam).\nThe scripture warns us, \n\u201cMi\u015bra\u1e43 pathyamapathya\u1e43 ca bhukta\u1e43 sama\u015bana\u1e43 mata\u1e43 vidy\u0101dadhya\u015bana\u1e43 bh\u016byo mukhyaparibhajana\u1e43 ak\u0101le bahuv\u0101l\u012bpa\u1e43 v\u0101 bhukta\u1e43 tu vi\u1e63ama\u015bana\u1e43 t\u012b\u1e47yat\u0101ni m\u1e5btyu\u1e43 v\u0101 ghor\u0101n vy\u0101dh\u012bnsyajanti v\u0101.\u201d \nThis implies that unbalanced, under-eating, and improper eating are significant causes of severe diseases and even death.\nLifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, asthma, cancer, memory loss, and life-threatening conditions like heart disease arise from such eating practices. \n\u201cGur\u016b\u1e47\u0101mardhasaubhitya\u1e43 lagh\u016bn\u0101\u1e43 n\u0101tityapath\u0101 m\u0101tr\u0101 pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 nirdi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e43 sukha\u1e43 t\u0101vat j\u012bryati\n.\u201d\n Heavy foods (Guru Dravya), such as meat, fish, milk, and curd, should be consumed in moderation\u2014ideally half the usual quantity. Light foods (Laghu Dravya) should not be consumed to the point of aversion. Eating food in the amount prescribed ensures proper digestion and promotes well-being.\nExcessive food (Atim\u0101tr\u0101) not only disturbs all bodily doshas but also places undue strain on the nervous, digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems, leading to various illnesses that affect vital organs. Ayurveda\u2019s balanced diet comprises grains, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals essential for daily sustenance. Classic texts like A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga H\u1e5bdaya recommend foods like rice, wheat, barley, and green gram for balance and nourishment. Proper eating at the right time, when hunger signals are apparent, aligns with the guidelines set by Ayurvedic masters, promoting good health and longevity.\nHowever, dietary patterns have undergone drastic changes with the British invasion and the rise in population. \nThe overuse of refined flour, sugar, and polished rice has contributed to a diabetes epidemic in Kerala. \nDiseases like cancer, heart ailments, asthma, arthritis, and strokes increasingly affect even the younger population. \nTubers like colocasia, yam, tapioca, and lesser yams, once staples of the commoner\u2019s diet during monsoon, have become exotic components today.\nCenturies ago, during the rainy season of \nKarkidakam\n, Kerala practiced the consumption of medicinal porridge and Panchakarma treatments. These traditions, aimed at rejuvenating the body and ensuring health for the coming year, included oil massages and therapeutic procedures. \nThe monsoon rains, rich in nitrogen due to lightning in the atmosphere, supported the growth of new plants, grass, and medicinal herbs. \nThis natural process also reflected changes in the human body, where cellular activity became more prominent. \nConsuming medicinal porridge prepared with newly harvested grains and medicinal herbs nourished the body and bolstered immunity, offering protection against health issues for the year ahead.\nPanchakarma treatments, involving various cleansing and rejuvenation therapies, were systematic practices aimed at ensuring bodily functions remained robust. \nLeguminous crops like green gram, horse gram, and cowpea, rich in protein, were consumed with jaggery and coconut for added strength and immunity. \nThese practices, followed meticulously year after year, had long-term benefits, even influencing DNA positively. Such health practices explain the global admiration for Panchakarma today, appreciated for its scientific foundation.\nEven with advanced treatments and higher life expectancy, modern lifestyles have led to diminished health quality. \nDespite taking precise medications, cancer patients and those suffering from chronic ailments often suffer from relentless pain, making it quintessential to revisit traditional Ayurvedic health practices for better well-being.\n \nWhat is the Ayurvedic Way of Eating?\nIn Ayurveda, how you eat is as important as what you eat. We are what we eat; our body is the manifestation of what we eat and do. The Ayurvedic way of eating encourages mindfulness, focusing entirely on your meal to ensure proper digestion. Some key principles include:\n1. Ayurvedic dietary guidelines:\nEating in a calm, clean environment.\nChewing food thoroughly to enhance digestion.\nEating warm, freshly prepared meals.\nAvoiding distractions like screens during meals.\nEating according to hunger and stopping before feeling full.\nIntake of food at the right time (Kale bhojana).\nFood intake as per suitability (satmya bhojana)\nFood intake as per the prakruthi of the individual (hita bhojan)\nProper hygiene (suchi bhojan)\nIntake of food which is unctuous (snigdha bhojan)\nIntake of food which is warm (ushna bhojan)\nIntake of food which is easy to digest (Laghu bhojan)\nEat while there is an interest in food, and while eating, concentrate on food and the process of eating (tan mana: bhojana)\nEat food with six taste components (sad-rasayukta ahara)\nFood should be primarily sweet in nature (madhura praya)\nFood should be ingested calmly, neither too slow nor too fast (na ati druta vilambita)\nFood should be taken after bathing (snatah)\nProper washing of hands, feet, and face should be done before food intake (dhauta pada-kara-anana:)\nAfter offering prayers and paying obeisance to gods and forefathers (pithru -deva tarpana)\nAfter offering food to guests, teachers, and children\nWithout disgracing food (anindan bhunjaana) and silently (moun)\nOne should eat the proper quantity of food at the appropriate time by sitting on a raised platform.\nAfter meals, we should sit comfortably like a king and then have a short walk. \n\u00a0\nAhara matra (quantity of food)\nThe food and nutritional requirements vary from person to person and depend upon the status of Agni, sharara prakriti, age, etc. \nSusruta and Vagbhata have suggested that if stomach capacity is hypothetically divided into four parts on the basis of its filling: one should take two parts of solid food, 1 part of liquid food, and 1 part should be left empty for easy movement of Vata.\n\u00a0\n2. Sequence of food intake\nWhen eating, first, we should take heavy, oily, sweet-tasting foods initially followed by salt and sour tastes and then pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes for proper activation of Agni, proper absorption, and assimilation of food.\nSweet taste helps to overcome vata buildup in the stomach in a hungry person; salt and sour tastes stimulate the digestive fire; and the pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes taken in the end subdue Kapha dosha.\nAlso, some fruits taken in the beginning help to overcome Vata dosha.\nIndian gooseberry is recommended to be taken at the start, middle, and end of the meal.\nOne should take heavy foods up to one-third of the fullness and light foods up to satiation.\nAfter taking food, it is advised to rest for muhurta (48 minutes) for proper digestion.\n\u00a0\n3. Ahara vidhi viseshaayatana (8-fold rules for food intake)\nTo receive the total benefits of Ahara, it is also necessary to know \n\u2018Ashta Sahara vidhivisheshaayatana\u201d\n they are\n\u00a0Prakriti: The food should be taken considering the nature of food, such as guru (Heavy food like milk, flesh), laghu (food like green gram, etc. which are light to digest), seeta (food which is cold in potency, such as milk), ushna (food which are of hot potency like spicy food), ruksha (dry ness inducing food), snigda( unctuous food such as ghee, butter) and their impact on agni.\nKarana: Refers to modification in the food property by the action of Agni, water, etc. Dadhi is a substance that is prohibited from being used after heating.\nSamyoga: Denotes the combinations of food that either augment or nullify the actions of the individual components.\nRaashi-this represents the quantum of food required for each person.\nDesha: features the dynamics and kinetics of the food consumed, which is dependent on the habitat of the individual and also the area from where the substance has originated.\nKaala: Represents time in terms of climate, phase of digestion, the\n \ntiming of the day, Stage (avastha) of disease, etc.\nUpayoga Samstha: The rule denoting food should be taken as per the rules of dietetics.\nUpayokta: Denotes the consumer of the food. Food intake should be guided by each individual\u2019s personal preference and okasatmya (habitual homologation).\n \nDietetic Incompatibility in Ayurveda\nVirudha ahara\nIn Ayurveda, the concept of \nvirudha aharam or \nincompressible food\n is very much pivotal in the pathogenesis of the disease. \nAcharya Charaka\n defines \nvirudha aharam \nas a specific diet and its combinations, which interrupt the metabolism, inhibit the process of formation of tissue, and have opposite properties to that of the tissue, are called ViruddhaAnna or incompatible diet. \nVirudha can be considered as a diet that has mutually contradictory properties, contradictory to tissues, a diet capable of producing an untoward effect on the body when processed in a particular form or proportion, or those foods that may have an unwanted effect when taken at an inappropriate time.\n Ayurvedic literature has compiled almost 18 types of \nvirudha ahara\n and has also mentioned complications ranging from skin diseases (\nkushta\n), \nvisarpa \n(erysipelas), \nunmada \n(insanity), and \nmarana \n(death).\n \nWhat is the Daily Food Routine in Ayurveda?\nAyurvedic routine for a healthy living includes:\nOn waking up: \nA glass of lukewarm water\nMorning:\n A light breakfast within 2 hours of waking up and should be easily digestible foods to kickstart digestion.\nNoon:\n The most significant meal of the day, as digestion is strongest when the sun is at its peak.\nEvening:\n A light dinner to promote restful sleep and avoid burdening the digestive system at night, ideally 3 hours before bed.\nImportance of Body Types for Choosing a Diet\nIn Ayurveda, choosing the proper diet begins with understanding your body constitution or \nDosha type\n\u2014Vata, Pitta, \nor \nKapha\n. Each Dosha has specific dietetic patterns, and a diet tailored to one\u2019s Prakriti can help maintain balance and health.\nVata \nBody Type\nThe functions of \nvata dosha\n in the body include movements in the body, the\n \nprocess of elimination, controlling the nervous system, etc. Dry, cold, and light by nature, \nVata \nindividuals benefit from warm, moist, and grounding foods. So they need smooth, heavy, warm qualities which are opposite to their qualities. \nDiet\nVata\n people should eat fresh, warm food with sweet, sour, and salty tastes. \nFoods like soups and cooked grains support balance.\nHealthy fats like ghee and olive oil nourish dryness.\nSweet, sour, and salty tastes, these tastes pacify \nVata dosha\n.\nThey should avoid fasting too much and also use spicy food to regulate their digestion.\nThey should include warm drinks, sweet fruits, raw nuts, milk, butter, cream, hot cereals, etc.\nPitta \nBody Type\nHot, sharp, flowing, slightly oily, and light, \nPitta \nindividuals thrive on cooling, calming, and non-spicy foods. \nPitta \naccumulates in the rainy season and gets aggravated in October. \nBalancing and strengthening a diet that is mainly sweet, bitter, and astringent will be perfect for this constitution.\nDiet\nCooling foods and drinks in the hot weather, especially fresh fruits, leafy greens, and cucumbers, and those with sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes, help calm pitta dosha and regulate heat.\nMild spices such as cardamom, fennel, and coriander aid digestion without aggravating \nPitta\nEating a primarily vegetarian diet, which suits the constitution, is preferred.\nAdequate intake of raw food and juices is indicated.\nCool water should be taken, and coffee, alcohol, black tea, pickles, vinegar, chilies, vegetable oils, bakery products, canned foods, instant foods, hybrid grains, etc., should be avoided.\nKapha Body Type\nHeavy, slow, slimy, and soft, Kapha individuals benefit from light, warm, and energizing foods. \nThe functions of \nKapha dosha\n in the body include protection, governing the structure of the body, providing immunity, holding the cells together, forming the muscles and bones, etc. \nDiet\nLight and warm foods such as steamed vegetables and soups are beneficial for \nKapha \nbody type.\nSpicy and pungent tastes like ginger, black pepper, and turmeric reduce heaviness.\nFocus on foods low in sugar, carbs, and fat and that are light and dry to help balance \nKapha\n.\nThey need food and drinks, which are opposite to their qualities. So they need challenging, warm, light foods with astringent, pungent, and bitter tastes.\nPeople with a Kapha constitution should avoid frequent eating, frozen edibles, and cold water.\n \nWhat are the Different Types of Food in Ayurveda?\nAyurveda categorizes food into three types based on its effect on the mind and body:\nSattvik Diet\nPromotes equilibrium and balance of the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.\nRich in prana (life forces), and energizes the body\nFoods that promote clarity, calmness, and purity (e.g., fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts).\nRooted in Ayurvedic principles, includes fresh, wholesome, easily digestible, and plant-based foods that promote physical health and mental clarity.\nEncourages calmness, clarity, and harmony.\nAvoids foods like onion, garlic, and stale items\nAvoids overly stimulating, spicy, sour, salty, heavy, stale, or processed foods, focusing instead on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and dairy in moderation\nAdopting a Sattvic diet can offer several health benefits: Its high fiber content supports improved digestion, while the emphasis on plant-based, low-fat foods may reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, the Sattvic diet helps support immunity and may help lower the risk of certain cancers.\nIt enhances mental clarity, reduces stress, and supports overall well-being. This approach to eating aligns with the holistic goal of maintaining harmony between the body, mind, and spirit.\nRajasik Diet\nAssociated with aggression and restlessness.\n\u00a0Includes spicy, fried, and stimulating foods.\nNot recommended for maintaining a calm and healthy state.\nTamasik Diet\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leads to lethargy, inertia, dullness, and imbalance.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Often includes stale, processed food and non-vegetarian items.\n\u25cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generally avoided for health and mental clarity.\nSattvic Recipes \nTurmeric Leaf Buttermilk\nIngredients:\nTurmeric leaves, ginger, chili, natural salt, curry leaves, and water.\nPreparation: Blend all ingredients into a buttermilk base.

Snacking between meals is discouraged, as it disrupts digestion. However, the number of meals per day should be determined by an individual\u2019s constitution (\nPrakriti\n), the\n \ndigestive fire (\nAgni\n), and daily routine. Let\u2019s explore this in detail:\nIndividual Variations in Meals\nAyurveda recognizes that meal frequency and size can vary based on one\u2019s dosha type:\nVata Dosha:\nVata individuals may benefit from eating smaller, frequent meals (3\u20135 times a day), as their digestion can be irregular.\nWarm, cooked meals with healthy fats are ideal.\nPitta Dosha:\nPitta individuals are blessed with a high metabolism, often have strong digestion, and manage to thrive on three well-balanced meals.\nAvoid overeating or skipping meals to maintain balance.\nKapha Dosha:\nKapha individuals benefit from two lighter meals a day or intermittent fasting, as their digestion tends to be slower.\nMeals should be light, warm, and spicy to improve metabolism.\nExceptions\nPregnant women, children, the elderly, or those with health conditions may require customized meal plans with additional smaller meals.\nAdditional Guidelines for Ayurveda Meals\nSnacking:\n Ayurveda generally discourages snacking between meals to allow the previous meal to be fully digested. If snacking is necessary, opt for light, easily digestible foods like fruits.\nEating Mindfully:\n Meals should be eaten in a calm environment, with full attention to the act of eating. Avoid multitasking or distractions such as TV, phones, etc. Even laughing and talking is restricted, as per Ayurveda.\nTime Between Meals:\n Allow at least 4 4-hour gap between meals for complete digestion; however, this may vary from individual to individual.\n \nAyurvedic Tips for Breakfast\nConsume after sunrise, when digestion is moderately active.\nIt should be light, nourishing, and easy to digest.\nFoods like porridge or light grains are often recommended.\nStart your day with light, warm foods like porridge or herbal tea\nAvoid heavy or cold foods like processed cereals, overnight foods, or chilled smoothies.\nAyurvedic Lunch\nMake lunch your largest meal, incorporating all six tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent) to aid digestion and provide balanced nutrition.\nThis is the most important meal of the day in Ayurveda because digestion is strongest during the middle of the day when the sun is at its peak.\nLunch should be the largest meal, including fresh vegetables, grains, proteins (lentils, beans, or dairy), buttermilk, and spices to support digestion.\nAyurvedic Dinner\nDinner should be the lightest meal of the day to support restful sleep.\nShould be eaten early, ideally before sunset or by 7 PM, to allow proper digestion before bedtime.\nOne can include Dinner soups, light grains, or steamed vegetables.\nHow the Ayurvedic Diet Helps in the Treatment of Diseases\nThe Ayurvedic diet plays a crucial role in managing and supporting the treatment of diseases by focusing on balancing the body\u2019s doshas (\nVata, Pitta, and Kapha\n) and strengthening the digestive fire (\nAgni\n), which is considered the cornerstone of health. \nThis ancient dietary approach is highly individualized, tailoring food choices to a person\u2019s constitution (\nprakriti\n), current imbalances, and seasonal changes. \nAyurvedic diets emphasize fresh, whole, and easily digestible foods while avoiding processed and incompatible food combinations that may aggravate imbalances.\n By incorporating specific spices, herbs, and cooking methods, the diet helps detoxify the body, improve nutrient assimilation, and enhance immunity.\n For example, a Vata-pacifying diet includes warm, moist, and grounding foods to stabilize erratic energy, while a Kapha-balancing diet incorporates light, spicy, and warming meals to reduce sluggishness. \nMoreover, Ayurveda recommends mindful eating practices, such as eating at regular times and avoiding overeating, to promote optimal digestion and prevent disease progression. \nThrough its personalized approach and focus on restoring harmony, the Ayurvedic diet acts as a natural, holistic tool to manage health conditions and support the body\u2019s innate healing capacity.\nBenefits of an Ayurvedic Diet\nA balanced diet is necessary for good health, yet many people neglect its importance in daily life. \nWhile education on balanced nutrition is widely accessible, its practical application remains limited. \nThis has led to an alarming rise in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity, which are still being managed through medication instead of dietary corrections. \nHowever, Ayurveda, the ancient science of life, emphasizes that diet is a powerful tool for maintaining health and preventing disease.\nAyurvedic diet supports physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It encourages mindful eating for better nutrient absorption and helps maintain \ndosha\n balance, reducing disease risk.\nAn Ayurvedic diet focuses on customizing the food choices of an individual with their unique body constitution (Prakriti) and imbalances (vikriti). \nIt advocates the use of fresh, wholesome, and easily digestible foods while avoiding processed and refined items. \nIt is deeply rooted in the principles of balance, emphasizing the incorporation of all six tastes\u2014sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent\u2014in meals to harmonize bodily functions. Ayurveda also incorporates seasonal and lifestyle adaptations, such as the use of cooling foods during summer and nourishing, warm meals in winter, to maintain equilibrium.\nKerala\u2019s traditional dietary practices follow many Ayurvedic principles. Earlier, unpolished rice, fresh fish, coconut, and a variety of seasonal vegetables and tubers provided essential nutrients, while medicinal porridges and Panchakarma treatments rejuvenated the body during the monsoon. \nThese practices contributed to Kerala\u2019s remarkable health metrics in the past, such as lower infant mortality rates and higher life expectancy.\n However, the\n \nmodern lifestyle has taken a toll on everyone\u2019s health.\nWith the introduction of modern dietary habits, people have shifted towards refined and processed foods, leading to an epidemic of lifestyle disorders.\n Ayurvedic practices, including detoxifying foods and immune-boosting herbs, offer a natural remedy to counteract these trends. \nPanchakarma therapies and medicinal rice porridges, rich in antioxidants and nutrients, help remove toxins and enhance cellular health.\nIn a world increasingly burdened by chronic ailments and environmental stressors, incorporating Ayurvedic dietary principles opens up a pathway to long-term health and vitality.\nThings to Consider While Preparing an Ayurvedic Diet\nWhile preparing an Ayurvedic diet, it is essential to consider the principles of Ayurveda, which help maintain balance among the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and promote holistic well-being. Here are key points to be taken care of:\nFocus on a Dosha-based diet\n.\nIdentify your dominant dosha and your body constitution (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha) through an Ayurvedic practitioner or self-assessment or the novel app developed by the NCISM (a Govt. of India body) to promote prakriti-based healing, the Prakruti Parikshan app, here\u2019s the link to the application \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artcode.prakrutiparikshan&pcampaignid=web_share\n.\nCustomize the diet:\n Identifying your dominant dosha can help you customize your diet and pacify any imbalances.\nPrioritise Fresh, Locally Produced and Seasonal Foods\nEat fresh, locally produced foods:\n Incorporate freshly prepared meals from locally produced ingredients, as they are considered to have more prana (life force).\nGo seasonal:\nConsume foods grown locally and seasonally to align with nature\u2019s rhythms.\nInclude All Six Tastes\nEnsure every meal includes the six Ayurvedic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. \nThis helps balance your doshas.\nEmphasise Digestive Health\nAvoid distractions while eating, and chew food thoroughly.\nChoose foods and spices that strengthen your digestive fire (\nAgni\n), such as ginger, cumin, or fennel.\nAvoid combining incompatible foods, like milk and fish, or fruit with dairy.\nUse Herbs and Spices Wisely\nAdd Ayurvedic herbs and spices like turmeric, coriander, cardamom, and asafoetida, which also aid digestion; however, do not use them excessively. Maintain a balance between flavors.\nFocus on dosha-specific spices; for example, Vata types benefit from warming spices, while Pitta types should favor cooling ones.\nCook with Sattvic Ingredients\nIncorporate sattvic foods (fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts) that promote clarity and calmness.\nAvoid tamasic and rajasic foods like overly processed, fried, or spicy foods that may disturb mental peace.\nHydrate Well \nSip room-temperature water to support digestion. Avoid cold beverages, which can hamper \nAgni\n.\nTry herbal teas, such as tulsi or cumin-coriander tea, suited to your dosha.\nFollow Mealtime Guidelines\nEat at consistent times to regulate digestion.\nAvoid overeating by leaving one-third of your stomach empty to allow proper digestion.\nEat your largest meal at midday, when Agni is strongest, ie..when the sun is directly above your head.\nPrefer Quality Over Quantity\nPrepare meals in a calm, positive environment and opt for ingredients that are organically grown in their natural environment. \nQuick Tips\nAvoid reheating foods or eating leftovers.\nReduce the practice of refrigerating foods.\nPractice portion control.\nRespect your cravings and allow them within the dosha-appropriate limits.\nWhat to Include in An Ayurvedic Diet\nFresh, seasonal, locally available (within 100 kilometers of a person\u2019s residence), and organic produce.\nGhee, whole grains, lentils, and spices like turmeric, cumin, and fennel.\nFoods cooked with love and mindfulness.\nWhat to Avoid in an Ayurvedic Diet\nProcessed, stale, and leftover foods.\nExcessive sugar, salt, and spices.\nUnnatural or artificial additives.\nIs Ayurveda Vegetarian?\nAyurveda is not vegetarian; while Ayurveda predominantly advocates a vegetarian diet, it incorporates non-vegetarian foods like fish and meat for those who require it, depending on their \nDosha \nand health conditions.\nWhat Should I Eat First in the Morning According to Ayurveda?\nAyurveda recommends starting your day with \na glass of warm water\n to activate digestion, followed by soaked nuts or fresh fruit to energize the body. \nYou may also incorporate herbal teas, such as ginger, tulsi, or fennel tea, which can improve digestion, balance doshas, and energize the body. Rice porridge cooked with ghee nourishes the body and calms the digestive system, especially for vata or pitta types. \nFor individuals with balanced digestion or specific health conditions, a teaspoon of ghee mixed in warm water can lubricate the digestive tract and support gut health. \nAvoid cold, processed, or heavy foods in the morning, as these can weaken digestion. \nAyurveda also encourages mindfulness while eating, so take your morning meal in a calm environment, allowing your body to absorb the nourishment fully.\nConclusion\nAyurveda is not just a science; it\u2019s a way of living a healthy and prosperous life. \nAyurvedic diet is an integral part of healthy living, and it provides extensive insights into food and health based on certain unique conceptual and theoretical positions. \nFood is an essential requirement in life and is considered one among the three upasthambhas (supports of life), i.e., Sahara (diet), Nidra (sleep), and brahmacharya (observance of celibacy); the first one has been given more importance and considered to be the best in Ayurveda. \nMost health problems develop due to the wrong eating habits and cooking methods.\u00a0 \nBy adopting an Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle, you can promote holistic health and prevent the onset of many lifestyle diseases. Remember, mindful eating and balance are at the heart of Ayurveda, guiding you toward a life of health and harmony.\n\u201cLet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\u201d"}
